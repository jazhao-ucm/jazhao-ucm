## Opening Discussion: Production Strategies

A. Key Question
1. "So let us, you do you have to price and cost is not the same."

B. Important Distinction
1. Cost ≠ Price
2. Low cost doesn't always mean low price
3. "So you may have a low cost and inside a low cost from that doesn't mean always that I will do that over us."

C. Production Strategy Options
1. "There are a few ways of convenience."
2. "The one is... So, we have these circles, we may have, wero and try to be on us."
3. "Or we may try to on dinner magic."
4. Different approaches to production efficiency

D. Competing on Low Cost
1. "So you see, we are competing on low loss and do everything entering everything."
2. Low cost as a competitive strategy

---

## Key Concepts

### I. Fixed vs. Variable Costs

A. Fixed Costs
1. Costs that don't change with the amount produced
2. Examples: Building, insurance, cleaning the room
3. "So the way since we may have this and day, and we still have to pay forward the building, making insurance clean the room."
4. "It does not depend on the amount of un re."

B. Variable Costs
1. Costs that change with the amount produced
2. Examples: Materials, wages (sometimes)
3. "So basically, the cost of all theers are being employed only in."
4. "And the value to the when they back here."

C. Key Insight
1. "So the thing starts are all because the resources that we have to weigh to theip."

D. Key Point
1. Fixed costs stay the same regardless of production volume. Variable costs increase with production.

E. Class Discussion on Cost Classification
1. Discussion about whether production costs are fixed or variable
2. "So what is a. . To make the robot?"
3. Student perspective: "I think it's fixed because you have a set amount of materials that are gonna cost the same. They might fluctuate like just with time, but I think it's fixed to make it."
4. "When we have sun again, So , we fucked that my US that. We thought that."
5. "So West when you have a roll front, you believe this the world of I' the Senate in known places right."
6. "And you have always a combination of community. So it's the way you were being is not always a sound. That is not always a sin."
7. Reality: Most businesses have a combination of both fixed and variable costs

F. Example Discussion
1. Location decisions affect costs
2. Production in Serbia vs. China vs. US
3. "So will you produce this PM? Yes. Sure. And you place that lo to my exist."
4. "So and we are the yes. Seria, New Servia."
5. "S is located . .. . ? In Europe. And it is cheaper to produce in S."
6. Labor costs vary by location
7. "Because it's cheaper, like. Like, maybe labor, maybe materials."
8. "I knew from, you they also quiet face."

---

### II. Cost Structure & Business Models

A. Key Principle
1. "So need, big class is you need changes here, G.able costs are wages, wages."

B. Different Industries Have Different Cost Structures

C. High Fixed Costs
1. Oil and gas plants
2. "So all from of a said, you got Ross, man, it's super large."
3. "I mean, to happier sing a faceical plant for your plant. For oil and gas, these are super chips, and they're super expensive."
4. "So the typically, a text cost is super."

D. Low Fixed Costs
1. Small businesses
2. "And I've give you built rock where the is the normal very small, is the all."

E. Key Insight
1. "So for example of a mistress cost and small mals are in oil and like shing, or mities,arily or kind of industry, where you see or are."

**Reality:** "This is a difficult where those large face, when we produce br."

---

### III. Economies of Scale

A. Key Concept
1. "So when the most of the is called the Gier that who will or with the effects because are larger, we larger than the."

**Definition:** As you produce more, the cost per unit decreases

B. Why It Happens
1. Fixed costs are spread over more units
2. "So the main equation now is began using the lot"
3. Larger production = lower cost per unit

C. Key Insight
1. "So that's me."

**Example:** "So, usually we need much, so basically musty or and then R She. Some machines."

---

### IV. Standardization & Mass Production

A. Key Concept
1. Standardization makes production cheaper and faster

B. The Process
1. "So if we want our has to be signed over in, we have some of the."
2. "We have have we afford and we get some."
3. "So this is not bees that is gonna be. Is going. Decide summer."

C. Class Discussion
1. "If we want to use or local of the mass of the work, , or rather. Which is easier."
2. Standardized vs. customized production
3. "Probably, the steam. Probably the standard one?"

D. Example - Plastic Production
1. "You you say, you a different amount of plastic to bring you the orient or the batus. Is it? You? Does it change?"
2. Standardization reduces variation
3. "So the same is that if you give your your hand large cost for the go, you need became idolation."

E. Key Insight
1. "So they from the in this case will be. As a well, you said, he made the indication of these standards and the standardes."

F. Benefits
1. Lower costs
2. Faster production
3. Easier to scale
4. "He's basically that a can standard lies and that's it what important thing, is the d., it means that all be a fring process would be always hand."
5. "So this an indication here, so this indication. This that may have So the last will be in."
6. "So when we, this highly style that's that mass imation li is I can't specialize him."

---

### V. Division of Labor & Specialization

A. Key Concept
1. Workers doing specific, repetitive tasks are more efficient

**The Question:** "So, D, if you know to do more you ask for more money. I'm right."

B. Class Discussion
1. "He said more, is it cheaper to have a worker who knows? Deeper knows how to performing made for that. Or is cheaper so you have some guy who who does knows to do wildwind."
2. Student response: "I feel like it's cheaper to get the first guy who, like, knows those things instead of one thing, 'cause it might be that the person who knows one thing might expect more money because he only knows that one thing."

**The Answer:** Specialization is cheaper

C. Why
1. "So, if we divide this, the second class where we get a stable Pacific, a lot."
2. "I not that much."
3. "We can hire people that we destinate people who knows why, we want to pay test."
4. "So, D, if you know to do more you ask for more money. I'm right."

D. Example
1. "Imagine you know you know, agents, both for Jign for. Your and for .."
2. Worker who knows multiple things vs. worker who knows one thing
3. "So they will you know how to do the different elements? Yes."
4. "And there's another guy who only knows who build a j knows with G."

E. Key Insight
1. "So this is a big configuration of abroad, where we get to use it either reducingation, or use in the weakest, or both."

**Reality:** Workers who do one thing repeatedly get better at it and faster.

---

### VI. Learning by Doing

A. Key Concept
1. The more you do something, the better and faster you get
