## Opening Discussion: Production Strategies

**Key Question:** "So let us, you do you have to price and cost is not the same."

**Important Distinction:**
- **Cost** ≠ **Price**
- Low cost doesn't always mean low price
- "So you may have a low cost and inside a low cost from that doesn't mean always that I will do that over us."

**Production Strategy Options:**
- "There are a few ways of convenience."
- "The one is... So, we have these circles, we may have, wero and try to be on us."
- "Or we may try to on dinner magic."
- Different approaches to production efficiency

**Competing on Low Cost:**
- "So you see, we are competing on low loss and do everything entering everything."
- Low cost as a competitive strategy

## Key Concepts

### 1. Fixed vs. Variable Costs

**Fixed Costs:**
- Costs that don't change with the amount produced
- Examples: Building, insurance, cleaning the room
- "So the way since we may have this and day, and we still have to pay forward the building, making insurance clean the room."
- "It does not depend on the amount of un re."

**Variable Costs:**
- Costs that change with the amount produced
- Examples: Materials, wages (sometimes)
- "So basically, the cost of all theers are being employed only in."
- "And the value to the when they back here."

**Key Insight:** "So the thing starts are all because the resources that we have to weigh to theip."

**Key Point:** Fixed costs stay the same regardless of production volume. Variable costs increase with production.

**Class Discussion on Cost Classification:**
- Discussion about whether production costs are fixed or variable
- "So what is a. . To make the robot?"
- Student perspective: "I think it's fixed because you have a set amount of materials that are gonna cost the same. They might fluctuate like just with time, but I think it's fixed to make it."
- "When we have sun again, So , we fucked that my US that. We thought that."
- "So West when you have a roll front, you believe this the world of I' the Senate in known places right."
- "And you have always a combination of community. So it's the way you were being is not always a sound. That is not always a sin."
- Reality: Most businesses have a combination of both fixed and variable costs

**Example Discussion:**
- Location decisions affect costs
- Production in Serbia vs. China vs. US
- "So will you produce this PM? Yes. Sure. And you place that lo to my exist."
- "So and we are the yes. Seria, New Servia."
- "S is located . .. . ? In Europe. And it is cheaper to produce in S."
- Labor costs vary by location
- "Because it's cheaper, like. Like, maybe labor, maybe materials."
- "I knew from, you they also quiet face."

---

### 2. Cost Structure & Business Models

**Key Principle:** "So need, big class is you need changes here, G.able costs are wages, wages."

**Different Industries Have Different Cost Structures:**

**High Fixed Costs:**
- Oil and gas plants
- "So all from of a said, you got Ross, man, it's super large."
- "I mean, to happier sing a faceical plant for your plant. For oil and gas, these are super chips, and they're super expensive."
- "So the typically, a text cost is super."

**Low Fixed Costs:**
- Small businesses
- "And I've give you built rock where the is the normal very small, is the all."

**Key Insight:** "So for example of a mistress cost and small mals are in oil and like shing, or mities,arily or kind of industry, where you see or are."

**Reality:** "This is a difficult where those large face, when we produce br."

---

### 3. Economies of Scale

**Key Concept:** "So when the most of the is called the Gier that who will or with the effects because are larger, we larger than the."

**Definition:** As you produce more, the cost per unit decreases

**Why It Happens:**
- Fixed costs are spread over more units
- "So the main equation now is began using the lot"
- Larger production = lower cost per unit

**Key Insight:** "So that's me."

**Example:** "So, usually we need much, so basically musty or and then R She. Some machines."

---

### 4. Standardization & Mass Production

**Key Concept:** Standardization makes production cheaper and faster

**The Process:**
- "So if we want our has to be signed over in, we have some of the."
- "We have have we afford and we get some."
- "So this is not bees that is gonna be. Is going. Decide summer."

**Class Discussion:**
- "If we want to use or local of the mass of the work, , or rather. Which is easier."
- Standardized vs. customized production
- "Probably, the steam. Probably the standard one?"

**Example - Plastic Production:**
- "You you say, you a different amount of plastic to bring you the orient or the batus. Is it? You? Does it change?"
- Standardization reduces variation
- "So the same is that if you give your your hand large cost for the go, you need became idolation."

**Key Insight:** "So they from the in this case will be. As a well, you said, he made the indication of these standards and the standardes."

**Benefits:**
- Lower costs
- Faster production
- Easier to scale
- "He's basically that a can standard lies and that's it what important thing, is the d., it means that all be a fring process would be always hand."
- "So this an indication here, so this indication. This that may have So the last will be in."
- "So when we, this highly style that's that mass imation li is I can't specialize him."

### 5. Division of Labor & Specialization

**Key Concept:** Workers doing specific, repetitive tasks are more efficient

**The Question:** "So, D, if you know to do more you ask for more money. I'm right."

**Class Discussion:**
- "He said more, is it cheaper to have a worker who knows? Deeper knows how to performing made for that. Or is cheaper so you have some guy who who does knows to do wildwind."
- Student response: "I feel like it's cheaper to get the first guy who, like, knows those things instead of one thing, 'cause it might be that the person who knows one thing might expect more money because he only knows that one thing."

**The Answer:** Specialization is cheaper

**Why:**
- "So, if we divide this, the second class where we get a stable Pacific, a lot."
- "I not that much."
- "We can hire people that we destinate people who knows why, we want to pay test."
- "So, D, if you know to do more you ask for more money. I'm right."

**Example:**
- "Imagine you know you know, agents, both for Jign for. Your and for .."
- Worker who knows multiple things vs. worker who knows one thing
- "So they will you know how to do the different elements? Yes."
- "And there's another guy who only knows who build a j knows with G."

**Key Insight:** "So this is a big configuration of abroad, where we get to use it either reducingation, or use in the weakest, or both."

**Reality:** Workers who do one thing repeatedly get better at it and faster.

---

### 6. Learning by Doing

**Key Concept:** The more you do something, the better and faster you get

**Example:**
- "So now, tell me, I need more or less efficient making notes as for work for giving your first home at the union. In that college."
- "Probably less.one dead. Probably less."

**Key Insight:** "So, when it was you would be the second thing of the last some writing in the life."

**The Process:**
- First time: Slow, make mistakes
- "So first. Throw that we do, France, so like we learned to write."
- "We made. We get. When we that we."
- "Unless we get bored, then we go. This is very, and then we go."

**Key Point:** "So this is what I've done. I this detail to learn in my very simple, simple last for U."

---

### 7. The Boredom Problem

**Key Challenge:** "So if we create a specific a simple class, we are talking this. If we create this in as very simple. We are h the."

**The Problem:**
- "It's a war there. That's of the same thing. All other time."
- "If you worker gets four, you getting the same pass, ciety, I mean."
- "What you imagine this I'm I do just this. Every single I have to be someone with this for the whole day all the rest of my life. This is your dream job. I'm not really you have."

**Key Insight:** Repetitive work leads to boredom and decreased motivation.

**The Solution:**
- "So soon you're later here, I will get a meeting with this."
- "I remember."
- "So how will you solve that situation?"

**Possible Solutions:**
- Rotate workers
- Provide breaks
- Increase pay
- Make work more interesting
- "Yeah. That's. You this all day. Week, anyone will week? Rolling."

---

### 8. The Replacement Problem

**Key Challenge:** "So our friend, if this guy breaks, is losing."

**The Problem:**
- Specialized workers are hard to replace
- "So how will you solve is that people are different places?"
- "Three? It takes so much time to like a new time."

**Key Insight:** "Yeah, I guarant. So we as a time to sufficient again, we do better."

**Solutions:**
- Train multiple people
- "So we have a tr there in 40 thing and duration."
- "Can we, like, promote them, like, move them up?"
- Replace with machines: "Speak what they do, the situation is trying to search to replace the guy with a machine. Doesn't get."

**Key Point:** "You see that? That's why of making that. So that's that's people get."

### 9. Henry Ford's Model T - Case Study

**The Innovation:**
- First car in the world to be produced in mass
- "Actually, the first car in the world to be produced mass."
- "And I tell you before bit, days I in and a 14 in."
- "Well, he this day."

**Key Difference:**
- "What was the difference between the British cars on this car?"
- "The biggest cars were estimates. So where an expensive from."
- "And four and 4, hey, Raino, mine, light go visit achie."
- "Because what happens, this guy and before signed this car."

**The Goal:** "So then, what kind of things do you think he would be plays to reduce aion cost of this world? To produce a chip car of all these 37, Sp mission."

**Key Insight:** "So he was not the first friend that he was of this, that he lived in."
- "Well, like was aned by four West invented by all. .. American."
- "So all byists are they practice the direction of women in."
- "Henry Ford said, he sold forotion for the thousand."

1. **Moving Assembly Line (Conveyor Belt System)**
   - "So for instance car. Every minute."
   - "I saw as, because he only produced Stash The since they were producing. As one."
   - "So ironically haveers. That's cool."

2. **Standardized, Interchangeable Parts**
   - "There is some nice, very.., say, why you?"
   - All parts were identical and interchangeable
   - "So while the end, so when we meet you. In your designer? Yeah, I did. Si designer."

3. **Workers Doing Specific, Repetitive Tasks**
   - "I ask him when you the dishes ain't. We have these world, mornings, and then he."
   - "Then he put on dream, and we have no bust my stories."
   - "And again, because this guy has."

4. **Precision Machinery**
   - "I mean, hiding are even more, this workers a CPA and they were all that, they were more efficient, and they workers democratic."

**Key Insight:** "So that's me, that's what included. These one week the first time, I'm you way of designing gods was I women."

---

### 11. The Results - Model T Success

**Production Time:**
- Before: 12 hours per car
- After: 2.5 hours per car
- Massive reduction in production time

**Cost Reduction:**
- Before: $850 per car
- After: $260 per car
- "So that's me, that's what included."

**Key Insight:** "You know desire, everything. Yeah, so you made, he was smash bull. You finding the So they were the best one to as the sunrise, flowing the sun."

**Impact:**
- Made cars affordable for average Americans
- Transformed industrial manufacturing forever
- "So all the wonderful words. Exactly."

**Key Point:** "And you so glad in the good day all these. What is? B. One thing because we finish this."

---

### 12. University Economics & Scaling

**Key Concept:** Universities have high fixed costs

**Fixed Costs in Universities:**
- Buildings
- Facilities
- Football fields
- Libraries
- "So then I the university, is basically us high it costs or high value."
- "This because you mean the norm, you know the room to the facil the football beach."
- "You have you fixing space."

**Key Insight:** "So does imagine that they spent we out and you. Here. The government, 34. Buses."

**Reality:** "Because we want to go at for and actually, Victoria has a reality and they have a lot. From here? So they have a lot of."

---

### 13. The New University Case Study

**The Story:**
- "So, this guy, used to be the best food build. He had a baby f some expensive."
- "So basically, what happened, I know you is to get to at in Char 400 service."
- "And sp and sitting in the West made the only 60,000 radio profit., he was investion."

**The Problem:**
- "He said he had coffee, so he came to the. Where, and we worked with him, thinking about watching."
- "The solution. You guys, you guys up in. Such a small and a b and deep of."
- "And one of the things that we and you missing?"

**The Solution:**
- Created a new university
- "So this guy now is created. University."

**Key Question:** "So, you, my God, so on us in this? I have been to do this."

---

### 14. Fixed Costs & Student Numbers

**Key Principle:** "West, West is the un Post of myne. H students and I have to visit."

**The Challenge:**
- "So, are these sides will not lay and provide me here the less of."
- Need enough students to cover fixed costs

**Key Question:** "So then, how many students do you think? They have to be at least for..."

**The Answer:** Need many students to cover fixed costs

**Key Insight:** "I do you wait for a. I degree to sing. Anyone who pay anything? No, sir."

**Reality:** "Here, anyone will bring. Nobody's answered? No one?"

---

### 15. Fixed Costs & Business Strategy

**Key Principle:** "Here, he said, you have a fixed investments. Why do you here? You or a lot of sex."

**The Strategy:**
- "So they won't hear asang he said, if your business is a this, your safe thing to be higher low."
- "If your business is based on an hour and information gen fixed class and blah, blah, blah, you need to have the last sex or no."

**Key Insight:** "But, lunch, right. Okay, so if you are expecting to have not super large, that services approach losing. Not, okay?"

**Reality:** "So if you were expecting not to sell that much, that's not a cool thing. So you don't have you when you miss."

**Key Point:** "So you need to be very large to sell for."

---

### 16. When to Use Mass Production Approach

**Key Principle:** "So when you apply this approach, when you the focus, the sell for for your bro are pre. Onlywise, you have to find easy."

**When It Works:**
- High fixed costs
- Need to produce large volumes
- "So this, when we."

**When It Doesn't Work:**
- Low volume production
- Custom products
- "What do we think of this say of these? Say? More than these fight. More than, More than 10,000."

**Key Insight:** "So people gave that pain. You need, is in place, because of them."

---

### 17. The University Planning Story

**The Consultation:**
- "Actually your secret. Before creating this university came to my bs for a family university and he came to a union to my university and he wanted that we founded that."

**The Advice:**
- "I said, 'Nowing. We made two many students for this large.'"
- "And I'm not sure they will need so many students to see the war."

**Key Insight:** "So when said are around to support the face costs, you are asking me. You see that?"

**The Result:**
- "So we have it. He found some bull who one in the range, this way."
- "So this is best, the faith in O. Did you get it? Yeah."

**Key Point:** Need enough students to cover fixed costs, otherwise the business model doesn't work.

---

### 18. The Westward Expansion Analogy

**Key Concept:** "So, and I explain is because I can this space, you say that this is saying British to this race."

**The History:**
- "Why did West oper Bayside? The main is that the space says that the first."
- "How was land out here? When the United States, especially when you moved when, different people in the east, where moving div worse the West."
- "There you know by colonies? Yeah, you say, right say, this one is yours."
- "After are the six godly Nolence to be from Ira are orders right."
- "So I' less, rising in space, are theers."
- "And the way it were getting the land is basically all guys to work interested in having , right?"
- "So all very, in that place and so with that force and every day. Right."
- "So we could run into the f ride club."
- "So that's how the West land was in the beginning than thingschanged from."

**The Principle:**
- "So the first to get to some place to you that place."
- "That's why I said that more is before that law has something that we have in that after that he was here."

**Key Insight:** First mover advantage - being first matters.

**Reality:** "Now this second race to get nerve... He a private moments. Death, those resources."

## Important Examples from Class

**Production Location Decisions:**
- Serbia vs. China vs. US production locations
- Labor costs vary by location
- Material costs may vary
- Location affects overall cost structure

**Henry Ford's Model T:**
- Reduced production time from 12 hours to 2.5 hours
- Reduced cost from $850 to $260 per car
- Used moving assembly line, standardized parts, specialization
- Made cars affordable for average Americans
- First mass-produced car in the world

**University Economics:**
- High fixed costs (buildings, facilities)
- Need many students to cover costs
- New university case study - needed enough students
- Scale matters for profitability
- Consultation story: warned about needing many students

**Fixed vs. Variable Costs:**
- Fixed: Building, insurance, facilities
- Variable: Materials, some wages
- Different industries have different structures
- Oil/gas = high fixed costs
- Small businesses = lower fixed costs

**Standardization Examples:**
- Plastic production - standardized amounts
- Color choices - standardization reduces costs
- Mass production requires standardization

**Specialization:**
- Workers doing one task = cheaper and faster
- But leads to boredom and replacement challenges
- Learning by doing improves efficiency
- Need to balance specialization with worker satisfaction
- Counterintuitive: specialized workers may ask for more pay, but hiring them is still cheaper overall

**Westward Expansion Analogy:**
- First to claim land gets it
- First mover advantage in business
- Historical context: US westward expansion

## Next Steps

- Continue with production strategies
- Explore more scaling examples
- Understand cost structures better
- Next class: Continue discussion

## Final Thought

**"Mass production requires scale - you need enough volume to cover fixed costs."**

Remember:
- Fixed costs stay the same regardless of volume
- Variable costs increase with production
- Economies of scale reduce cost per unit
- Standardization and specialization increase efficiency
- But specialization has downsides (boredom, replacement)
- Business model must account for fixed costs
- Scale matters for profitability
