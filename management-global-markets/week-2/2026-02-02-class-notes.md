## Key Concepts

### 1. Products from Different Countries

**Quality vs. Cost Trade-offs:**

**Japan:**
- Known for high quality products
- "When you buy Japan, you buy quality"
- More expensive but reliable
- Example: Japan exports high-quality planes

**China:**
- Known for repetition and mass production
- Lower cost but quality varies
- "China and repetition" - focus on volume
- Products may not be built to last
- Important trading partner with America

**Key Insight:** Quality often comes at a higher price. Different countries specialize in different aspects of production.

### 2. Global Supply Chain Example - Personal Items

**Example from Class:**
Everything a person wears comes from different countries:
- **Jewelry** - From Vietnam
- **Shoes** - From Vietnam (specifically the sole)
- **Jewelry (silver/gold)** - From Botswana
  - Gold and silver prices went up 200% in one year
- **Shirt** - From India (70% cotton, not 100% from America)
- **Watch** - From China

**Key Point:** Modern products are rarely 100% from one country. Globalization means products are assembled from components made in multiple countries.

### 3. International Business Risks

**When moving a company from one country to another, you face different risks:**

1. **Cultural Risks:**
   - Different cultural norms
   - Different values and beliefs
   - Communication barriers

2. **Legal Risks:**
   - Different legal systems
   - Different regulations
   - Compliance requirements

3. **Logistical Risks:**
   - Transportation complexity
   - Supply chain challenges
   - Infrastructure differences

4. **Financial Risks:**
   - Different currencies
   - Exchange rate fluctuations
   - Tax systems

5. **Communication Risks:**
   - Language barriers
   - Different communication styles
   - Misunderstandings

**Key Insight:** "You cannot escape communication and language" - this is one risk you must face and adapt to, you cannot avoid it.

### 4. Market Attractiveness Indicators

**Factors to Consider When Choosing a Market:**

**GDP Growth:**
- Measure of economic growth
- Indicates market potential
- Higher GDP growth = more attractive market

**Population Growth:**
- More people = larger market
- Indicates future market size
- Important for long-term planning

**Political Risk:**
- Measure of political stability
- Risk from political changes
- General stability in the country
- Important for business security

**Examples:**
- **Low Risk Countries:** USA, UK, France, Germany
- **Medium Risk:** Various developing countries
- **High Risk:** Countries with political instability

---

### 5. Tax Systems & Trade Barriers

**Why Taxes Vary by Country:**

**Protectionism:**
- Countries use taxes to protect their industries
- "We apply high taxes on what we don't need"
- "We apply low taxes on what we need but don't produce"

**Purpose of Trade Barriers:**
- Protect domestic industries
- Control imports
- Encourage local production
- Manage competition

**Example:** 
- High taxes on products already produced domestically
- Low taxes on needed products not produced locally

**Key Point:** Tax systems are tools for economic protection and strategic trade management.

---

### 6. Competition Strategy

**What is Competition?**
- Companies doing the same thing
- Offering similar products/services
- Competing for the same customers

**How to Beat Competitors:**
- **Lower prices** - Undercut competitors
- **Better quality** - Superior products
- **Better service** - Customer experience
- **Innovation** - New features or solutions

**Key Question:** When entering a new market, do you:
- **Avoid competitors** (go where there are few)?
- **Work with competitors** (learn from them)?

---

### 7. Market Entry Strategy - Competition Analysis

**Scenario:**
You're entering a new market. You have two options:

**Option B:** Market with many competitors already doing what you do
- Lots of competition
- Established market
- Customers already exist
- Infrastructure in place

**Option C:** Market with very few competitors
- Little competition
- Less established market
- Fewer customers
- Less infrastructure

**Correct Answer: Go to Option B (where competitors exist)**

**Why?**
- **Competitors = Market validation** - If competitors are there, there's demand
- **Infrastructure exists** - Transportation, suppliers, distribution
- **You can learn** - Study what competitors do
- **Customers exist** - Market is already developed
- **Resources available** - Money, technology, FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)
- **You can differentiate** - Find what makes you different

**Key Insight:** "You cannot escape competition" - It's better to compete in an established market than try to create a new one alone.

**Example from Instructor:**
- French company tried to enter Mexico market alone
- Avoided competitors
- Failed because: no market infrastructure, no customers, no guidance
- Lesson: Working with competitors helps you learn and succeed

---

### 8. Porter's Five Forces Model

**Tool for Analyzing Competition:**
- Used at university level
- Analyzes competitive environment
- Helps understand market dynamics
- Identifies competitive advantages

**Key Point:** Understanding competition is crucial for market entry strategy.

---

### 9. Culture Definition

**Culture:** "The set of shared beliefs, values, and other norms that distinguish one group of people from another."

**Key Elements:**
- Shared beliefs
- Shared values
- Shared norms
- Distinguishes groups from each other

**Impact on Business:**
- Culture shock is massive and important
- People from different countries have different:
  - Religions
  - Beliefs
  - Values
  - Ways of thinking
- "We don't have the same God" - fundamental differences exist

**Key Insight:** Culture is one of the biggest challenges in international business. You cannot escape it - you must adapt.

### 10. Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions (Review & Expansion)

**Geert Hofstede** - Studied IBM employees across different countries
- Identified 5 different cultural dimensions
- Traveled with American company
- Found differences across countries

**The Five Dimensions:**

#### 1. Power Distance
- **High Power Distance:** Strong hierarchy, boss is clearly superior
- **Low Power Distance:** Flat hierarchy, more equal relationships
- Examples: Spain (high), Mexico (very high), Northern Europe (low), USA (low)

#### 2. Individualism vs. Collectivism
- **Individualism:** People in rich countries tend to be more individualistic
- **Collectivism:** People in poorer countries tend to be more collective/group-oriented
- Examples: USA (high individualism), many Asian countries (high collectivism)

#### 3. Masculinity vs. Femininity
- Differences in gender roles
- How men and women relate in business
- Varies by country and culture

**Instructor's View:** "There is no big difference between men and women. They are the same people. I don't consider differences."

#### 4. Uncertainty Avoidance
- How comfortable people are with uncertainty
- Some cultures prefer rules and structure
- Others are more comfortable with ambiguity

#### 5. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (NEW)

**Long-Term Orientation (High):**
- Focus on future planning
- Examples: USA, many Western countries
- People think about:
  - Getting a job
  - Getting married
  - Buying a house
  - Retirement
  - Long-term security
- "You think now, you don't know you have a job, but you plan for it"

**Short-Term Orientation (Low):**
- Focus on present
- Examples: Some developing countries
- People think about:
  - Surviving today
  - Immediate needs
  - Current problems
- "You need help now because you can't plan - you're not rich, you don't know if something will happen"

**Key Insight:** Long-term orientation is possible when you have security and resources. Short-term orientation comes from necessity and uncertainty.

**Special Case - Gender Equality:**
- **Iceland:** Zero difference between men and women (most equal in the world)
- **Norway, Sweden:** Also very high equality
- **France:** Less clear, but improving
- **100,000 people across 50 countries** - Significant sample size
- Still don't fully understand why some countries remain unequal

---

### 11. Culture Shock & Adaptation

**The Honeymoon Phase:**
- Initial excitement when entering new country
- Everything seems new and exciting
- "Do you remember the day you left the USA?"
- Feeling of adventure and possibility
- "You don't know what's coming, but something"

**Reality:**
- Adaptation is difficult
- Learning new language is tough
- Understanding new culture takes time
- Business becomes challenging

**Instructor's Experience:**
- Young French person going to Chile
- Didn't speak Spanish
- Had to adapt to:
  - New environment
  - New way of living
  - New way of working
  - New language
- "Do you think it's easy? It's not easy."

**Key Point:** Culture shock is inevitable. You must face it and adapt - you cannot escape it.

---

### 12. Logistics & Transportation

**Container Shipping:**
- **China is the biggest** - Huge vessels pulling containers
- Different containers for different goods:
  - **Dry containers** - Nothing special inside
  - **Refrigerated containers** - Control temperature and humidity
  - **Special containers** - For specific goods
- Different sizes and colors indicate different types of goods/services

**Why Different Containers?**
- We don't use the same transportation for all goods
- Different products need different handling
- Temperature control for perishables
- Special handling for fragile/valuable items

**Key Point:** Logistics is complex - different goods require different transportation methods.

---

### 13. Global Manufacturing & Assembly

**Example: Aircraft Assembly (Chicago):**
- Parts come from multiple different countries
- Assembled in one location (Chicago)
- "Where do we assemble the aircraft? In the world?"
- Different parts from different streets/countries
- Why? Because:
  - Different countries specialize in different parts
  - Quality differences
  - Cost differences
  - Expertise differences

**Key Insight:** Modern manufacturing is global - products are assembled from parts made worldwide.

---

### 14. Diversity in Global Business

**People from Different Backgrounds:**
- White people, Black people, Asian people
- People from different countries
- Different competencies
- Different skills and expertise

**Key Point:** "The best workers in the world" come from diverse backgrounds. Diversity brings different competencies and perspectives.

**Trade-offs:**
- Different competencies
- Different prices
- Different quality levels
- Different expertise

---
