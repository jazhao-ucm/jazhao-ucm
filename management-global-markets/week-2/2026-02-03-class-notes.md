## Key Concepts

### 1. Power Distance - Detailed Characteristics

**High Power Distance Countries:**

**Characteristics:**
1. **More powerful people expect to receive more privileges**
   - Bosses get special treatment
   - Hierarchy determines benefits
   - Examples: Russia, Japan, Mexico, Spain, France

2. **Subordinates are considered socially and legally inferior**
   - Employees have lower status
   - Clear social separation
   - Not considered equals

3. **Members accept power distance as part of social order**
   - Determines what is right and wrong
   - Hierarchy is seen as natural
   - Examples: Spain, Mexico, many Latin American countries

4. **Low trust among coworkers**
   - People don't share information easily
   - Information is kept to oneself
   - Selfish behavior is common
   - Not helpful for collaboration

**Low Power Distance Countries:**
- **High trust among coworkers**
- **Information sharing is common**
- **Collaborative environment**
- Examples: Sweden, Iceland, Northern Europe, USA

**Key Insight:** Power distance is not black and white - it's a scale from 0 to 100. Countries fall somewhere on this spectrum.

**Examples:**
- **USA:** Low power distance
- **Russia:** High power distance
- **Japan:** High power distance
- **Spain:** Very high power distance
- **France:** High power distance
- **Sweden/Iceland:** Very low power distance

### 2. Power Distance in Practice

**Instructor's Experience in Mexico:**
- Was 27 years old, "baby boss"
- Had people older than him working for him
- They had to wait in line, couldn't do job wrong
- Extreme hierarchy and respect for position
- "There is nothing worse in this world than working with people who will take advantage"

**Micromanagement:**
- Common in high power distance cultures
- Bosses closely control employees
- Less autonomy for workers

**Key Point:** In high power distance cultures, the boss's position matters more than age or experience.

---

### 3. Mistakes and Blame Culture

**High Power Distance:**
- Employees try to hide mistakes
- Fear of punishment
- Blame culture - "It's your fault"

**Low Power Distance (USA example):**
- "If you make a mistake, it's fine"
- Boss's job is to correct, not punish
- "I'm here to help you"
- System tries to fix problems together
- "We don't fire people we need"

**Example:**
- Instructor had 300 workers in Mexico factory
- Can't fire all of them - you need them
- Must work together to solve problems

**Key Insight:** In low power distance cultures, mistakes are learning opportunities. In high power distance, mistakes are failures to be hidden.

---

### 4. Experience vs. Education

**High Power Distance:**
- More credit given to experience
- Older, experienced people valued more
- Age = wisdom and respect

**Low Power Distance:**
- More credit given to education
- Young educated people can advance
- Merit-based advancement

**Key Point:** Different cultures value experience vs. education differently.

---

### 5. Culture Shock - The 4 Phases

**Phase 1: Euphoria (Honeymoon Phase)**
- Everything is exciting and new
- "I love it here!"
- High positive feelings
- Duration: Days to weeks
- Example: "Do you remember the day you left the USA? Excitement?"

**Phase 2: Culture Shock (Crisis Phase)**
- Everything feels wrong and annoying
- "Why do they do things this way?!"
- Food tastes weird, people act strange
- Low negative feelings
- Duration: Weeks to months (WORST PHASE)
- **What happens:** People often leave and go back home
- Example: Instructor in Chile - didn't understand language, culture, had no communication, felt alone

**Phase 3: Acculturation (Recovery Phase)**
- Starting to understand why they do things
- Learning step by step
- Beginning to adapt
- Feelings improving
- Requires: **Empathy** and **Cultural Intelligence**
- **Key:** Don't wait, don't be a "wimp" - stick with it

**Phase 4: Stable State (Adaptation Phase)**
- Feels normal now
- Might even prefer their way
- Fully adapted
- High positive feelings again

**Key Insight:** "You need time. Take your time. It's a slow process, slow business, and you need time and energy."

---

### 6. Cultural Distance

**Definition:** The difference between your home country and target country across cultural dimensions.

**Why It Matters:**
- Smaller cultural distance = easier to do business
- Larger cultural distance = harder to adapt
- Affects how long it takes to reach "stable state"

**Example:**
- **USA to UK:** Small cultural distance (same language, similar culture)
- **USA to Middle East:** Large cultural distance (different language, religion, customs)
- **Mexico to Spain:** Medium cultural distance (same language, different customs)

**Key Point:** People from similar cultures (like USA/UK) reach the "middle" (stable state) faster than people from very different cultures.

---

### 7. Integration Process - The Journey

**The Path to Cultural Integration:**

**Step 1: Academic Knowledge (High School)**
- Low level of cultural knowledge
- Books and lectures
- Theoretical understanding

**Step 2: Training Method (College)**
- Case studies
- Cultural awareness begins
- Still learning

**Step 3: Cultural Intelligence**
- Gained through experience
- Living in different culture
- Understanding how to work with different people
- "You're lucky to be here" - studying abroad

**Step 4: Integration**
- Working in different countries
- Full adaptation
- Professional competence in cross-cultural environment

**Key Insight:** It's a step-by-step process. You don't start integrated - you grow into it through education, experience, and time.

---

### 8. The Integration Graph

**Understanding Your Position:**

**Left Side (Simple):**
- Easy environments
- Can talk, laugh, be casual
- Friendly atmosphere

**Right Side (Complex):**
- Professional environments
- More formal
- Business settings
- Less casual interaction

**Key Point:** Where you are depends on:
- Your education
- Your experiences
- Your cultural background
- The environment you're in

**Example:** 
- Student life = more on the left (simple, casual)
- Professional work = more on the right (complex, formal)

---

### 9. Communication - The 35/65 Rule

**The Rule:**
- **35%** = What you say (actual words)
- **65%** = How you say it (non-verbal communication)

**Non-Verbal Communication Includes:**
- Facial expressions
- Tone of voice
- Gestures
- Eye contact
- Posture
- Movement
- Body language

**Key Insight:** "How you say it matters way more than what you say."

**Studies Show:**
- In communication, non-verbal expressions are **65% to 93%** more influential than words
- **93%** - That's a lot!

**For Business:**
- In negotiations, how you act is crucial
- Shows your motivation, preparation, and experience
- Sometimes what you're NOT saying is more important than what you ARE saying

**Example:**
- Don't just say "I'm motivated" - SHOW it with:
  - Enthusiasm
  - Eye contact
  - Energy
  - Positive body language

---

### 10. Verbal vs. Non-Verbal Language

**Verbal Language:**
- What we say
- The actual words
- Can be translated

**Non-Verbal Language:**
- What we don't say
- Body language, gestures, expressions
- Often more important than words
- Harder to translate across cultures

**Key Point:** In negotiations and business, non-verbal communication is crucial. Sometimes what we're not saying is more important than what we are saying.

---

### 11. Cultural Similarities & Differences

**What Creates Similarity:**
- **National boundaries** - People from same country
- **Shared experiences** - Same background
- **Language** - Same communication
- **Values** - Similar beliefs

**What Creates Differences:**
- **Gender** - Different cultures give different credit to men vs. women
- **Age** - Different value placed on youth vs. experience
- **Family** - Different family structures and values
- **Language** - Different ways of communicating
- **Religion** - Different beliefs and practices
- **Sports/Interests** - Different cultural activities

**Example from Class:**
- Students naturally grouped by nationality
- French students sat together
- Spanish students sat together
- "You go where you feel better" - natural grouping by culture

**Key Insight:** "The basic similarity amongst people within countries is both a cause and an effect of national boundaries."

---

### 12. Market Entry Simulation Game

**The Game Concept:**
- Managing a restaurant chain going international
- Pick a home country
- Decide which other countries to open restaurants in over 6 years
- Like Monopoly, but with countries instead of streets

**Key Factors to Consider:**

#### Part 1: Economic Factors

**GDP Per Capita:**
- How much money the average person makes
- Rich countries = people can afford to eat out more
- Example: Australia has high GDP per capita

**GDP Growth:**
- Is the country getting richer or poorer?
- Fast-growing countries = future customers
- Good place to open restaurant

**Population:**
- How many people live there
- More people = more potential customers

**Bottom Line:** Look for countries where people have money NOW and the country is getting richer LATER.

#### Part 2: Risk & Competition

**Country Risk:**
- How unstable is the country?
- Could government change, economy crash, or wars happen?
- Risky countries = restaurant might fail due to things you can't control

**Trade Barriers (Tariffs):**
- Taxes on imported stuff
- "You want to bring ingredients from home? That'll cost extra!"
- High tariffs = ingredients cost more = food costs more = fewer customers

**Industry Rivalry:**
- How many other restaurants are already there?
- Too many competitors = hard to succeed

#### Part 3: Culture (The BIGGEST Part)

**Cultural Distance:**
- Compare your home country to target country on all 6 Hofstede dimensions
- Bigger difference = harder to do business
- Small cultural distance = customers understand you better = easier to succeed

---

### 13. Hofstede's 6 Dimensions (Review)

**1. Power Distance (PDI)**
- High = Boss is boss, don't question
- Low = Everyone equal-ish
- For restaurants: High = formal service, Low = casual service

**2. Individualism (INV)**
- Individualistic = "I want what I want" (USA, Australia)
- Collectivistic = "What's good for the group?" (China, India)
- For restaurants: Individualistic = flexible menus, Collectivistic = family meals

**3. Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS)**
- Masculine = Success = money and power (Japan, USA)
- Feminine = Success = good relationships (Nordic countries)
- For restaurants: Masculine = fancy status symbol, Feminine = cozy family place

**4. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI)**
- High = "We've always done it this way" (Japan, France)
- Low = "Let's try something new!" (USA, Australia)
- For restaurants: High = traditional menu, Low = fusion food

**5. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (LTO)**
- Long-term = Think about future (China)
- Short-term = Think about right now (USA)
- For restaurants: Long-term = stability, Short-term = trendy

**6. Indulgence**
- High = "Life is for enjoying!" (Latin America)
- Low = "Discipline first" (East Asia)
- For restaurants: High indulgence = MORE CUSTOMERS (they love eating out)!

---

### 14. Customs & Traditions

**Different countries have different ways of doing things:**

**Example: Starting a Meeting**
- **Germany:** Formal, get straight to business (0 mins)
- **Finland:** Formal, coffee, then business (5 mins)
- **USA:** Informal, coffee, chit-chat, then business (3 mins)
- **UK:** Formal, tea and small talk about weather (10 mins)
- **France:** Formal, 15 mins chatting about politics (15 mins)
- **Japan:** Super formal, tea, protocol, big guy starts (20 mins)
- **Spain/Italy:** Very informal, small talk while waiting (30 mins)

**For Restaurants:** You need to understand how people like to eat and socialize in that country.

---

### 15. Religion

**Major Religions:**
- **Christianity:** ~2.4 billion people
- **Islam:** ~1.9 billion people
- **Hinduism:** ~1.2 billion people
- **Buddhism:** ~530 million people
- **Judaism:** ~16 million people

**Why It Matters:**
- Some religions have food rules (Halal, Kosher, Vegetarian)
- Holy days affect when people want to eat out
- Values in religion affect what customers want

**For Restaurants:** Respect food rules, know holiday calendars, understand values.

---

### 16. Cultural Empathy

**Definition:**
Understanding and appreciating how other people's culture is different from yours - NOT because it's weird, but because it makes sense in THEIR context.

**Why It Matters:**
- More tolerant of differences
- Better at business across cultures
- Happier life overall
- Better employee/manager

**Simple Version:** Just because something is different doesn't mean it's wrong. Try to understand WHY they do it.

**Key Point:** "People are more tolerant of differences in others" when you have cultural empathy.

---

### 17. Real-World Examples

**Instructor's Travel Experience:**
- Traveled extensively for work
- Spent weekends flying from Mexico to other countries
- Traveled to Africa, Asia
- Shows reality of international business life

**Key Insight:** International business requires constant travel and adaptation.

**Paris Metro Example:**
- Instructor's phone was stolen on metro
- Shows challenges of adapting to new places
- Need to be aware of local realities

---

### 18. The Bottom Line: How to Succeed in New Markets

**✅ DO:**
- Study GDP, growth, and population (who can afford you?)
- Check country risk (is it stable?)
- Understand cultural dimensions (how do they think?)
- Learn customs and traditions (how do they do things?)
- Watch your communication (show enthusiasm, not just tell)
- Respect religions and food rules
- Be prepared for culture shock in yourself and employees
- Develop cultural empathy
- Take your time - integration is a slow process

**❌ DON'T:**
- Assume your home country way is the only way
- Ignore high tariffs and trade barriers
- Enter markets with too much competition without a plan
- Try to change a country's culture to match yours
- Give up during culture shock phase
- Hide mistakes - learn from them

**🎯 REAL TALK:**
- Host countries don't always want you to change completely to their way
- They might accept that you're different
- BUT smart international companies look at what works in other cultures and bring those ideas back home

---
