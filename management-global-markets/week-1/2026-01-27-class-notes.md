## Chapter 2: The Silent Language in Business – Cross-Cultural Competence

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. National vs. International Operations

**National Operations:**
- Working with people from the same culture
- Makes things less complicated
- Easier communication and understanding
- Shared language and cultural norms

**International Operations:**
- Working with people from different cultures
- More complex and challenging
- Requires cross-cultural competence
- Need for empathy and understanding

**Key Insight:** When working internationally, we can't assume everyone shares the same culture, language, or business practices.

---

### 2. Cross-Cultural Competence & Empathy

**What You Need to Work Internationally:**
- **Language** - Communication is essential
- **Empathy** - Understanding different perspectives
- **Cultural awareness** - Recognizing differences

**Without empathy:** "Inside company, and you go nowhere."

**Example:** If you're 25 years old managing people in different countries, you need empathy to understand their perspectives and work effectively.

---

### 3. Value Chain Analysis (Michael Porter)

**Definition:** A tool to analyze company activities and identify which create value vs. which are costs.

**Purpose:**
- Recognize which activities are valuable or sources of cost
- Identify differentiation advantages
- Determine competitive advantages
- Find areas for improvement within the company

**Key Question:** What can we improve inside the company to increase profitability?

---

### 4. Primary Activities vs. Support Activities

**Primary Activities** (Everything related to the product itself):
1. **Inbound Logistics** - Receiving, storing raw materials
2. **Operations** - Production/transformation of goods
3. **Outbound Logistics** - Moving finished products to customers
4. **Marketing & Sales** - Promoting and selling products
5. **Service** - Customer support and after-sales service

**Support Activities** (Departments that support primary activities):
1. **Procurement** - Purchasing raw materials, supplies
2. **Technology Development** - R&D, innovation
3. **Human Resources** - Hiring, training, supporting employees
4. **Infrastructure** - Management, finance, administration

**Key Difference:**
- **Primary activities** = Directly create value and generate revenue
- **Support activities** = Enable primary activities but don't directly generate revenue

**Important:** All departments work together and are connected. Managers must communicate across departments.

---

### 5. Marketing vs. Sales

**Marketing:**
- What you show to get customers
- Creates awareness and interest
- Comes first

**Sales:**
- What gets the money
- Converts interest into purchases
- Comes after marketing

**Process:** Marketing → Sales → Profit

---

### 6. Internationalization Process

**The Order of Internationalization:**

When moving a company to a new country, departments move in this order:

1. **Sales** (First)
   - Need to explore new markets
   - Find new customers
   - Test the market

2. **Marketing** (Second)
   - Support sales efforts
   - Build brand presence
   - Understand local market

3. **Operations/Production** (Later)
   - Only after establishing market presence
   - If it becomes cheaper to produce locally
   - After many years of successful sales

**Why This Order?**
- You need to check the market first (sales)
- Marketing supports sales efforts
- Production is expensive and risky - only move when it makes economic sense

**Timeline:** This process takes many years, not just one year.

**Example:** Instructor's experience - took 2 years just to move sales department from France to Chile.

---

### 7. Globalization vs. Internationalization

**Globalization:**
- Moving departments to different locations
- Isolating departments in different countries
- Example: Production in China, Sales in USA, R&D in Europe
- "We're not moving the whole world, we're isolating departments"

**Internationalization:**
- Moving entire company operations to a new country
- Complete relocation of business

**Key Difference:** Globalization involves fragmenting operations across countries, while internationalization involves moving everything together.

---

### 8. Logistics & Supply Chain

**What You Need for Logistics:**
- **Good and strong infrastructure**
- **Warehouses** - Storage facilities
- **Transportation** - How to move goods
- **Distribution networks** - How to sell and deliver

**Four Types of Transportation:**
1. **Truck** - For continental/land transport
2. **Train** - For land transport
3. **Ship** - 95% of world trade (most important)
4. **Plane** - For urgent/time-sensitive goods

**Key Point:** Ships handle 95% of all world trade - most goods move by sea.

---

### 9. Procurement & Purchasing

**Why Look for Different Suppliers?**
- Different needs
- Price comparison
- Quality comparison
- Delivery time options
- Always negotiate prices

**Key Principle:** "You buy, you don't want to buy, you need to buy something. So price goes up."

**Location Considerations:**
- **Simple products** - Can produce anywhere (e.g., bread)
- **Complex products** - Need to stay in certain locations (e.g., advanced technology)
- Example: Can't send complex products to China for production if they require specific expertise

**Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):**
- When foreign companies invest in your country
- Creates competition
- Can benefit local economy

### 10. Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions

**Geert Hofstede** - Psychologist who studied IBM employees across different countries

**Key Cultural Dimensions:**

1. **Masculinity vs. Femininity**
   - Different ways men and women relate
   - Varies by culture

2. **Collectivism vs. Individualism**
   - **Individualism:** People in rich countries tend to be more individualistic
   - **Collectivism:** People in poorer countries tend to be more collective/group-oriented

3. **Power Distance** (Most Important for Management)
   - **High Power Distance:**
     - Strong hierarchy
     - Boss is clearly superior
     - Employees show great respect/fear to boss
     - Examples: Spain, Mexico, North Korea
     - Employees do everything to please boss, avoid being fired
   
   - **Low Power Distance:**
     - Flat hierarchy
     - Boss and employees work together as equals
     - Examples: Northern Europe, USA
     - More casual relationships

**Examples:**
- **Spain:** High power distance - "If you talk back to manager, you get fired"
- **Mexico:** Very high power distance - Instructor was 27 years old making much more than older employees
- **Northern Europe:** Low power distance - Everyone works together, no hierarchy

---

### 11. Power Distance & Management

**High Power Distance Countries:**
- Boss has absolute authority
- Employees fear boss
- Employees won't challenge or question
- Example: If instructor asks student to leave, student leaves immediately because instructor is "the boss"

**Low Power Distance Countries:**
- More collaborative
- Employees can question managers
- More equal relationships

**Management Insight:**
- "A good manager always blames yourself"
- If you have to fire someone, it's because you're doing something wrong
- Don't blame employees - take responsibility
- "We don't control people, we manage them"

**Warning:** Power distance can lead to abuse of power. Some professors/managers think they're great just because of their position.

---

### 12. Hierarchy Differences Across Cultures

**Spain:**
- Strong hierarchy
- Can't talk back to manager
- High power distance

**Mexico:**
- Very high power distance
- Extreme hierarchy
- Salary differences reflect power distance

**USA:**
- More individualistic
- Lower power distance
- More equal relationships

**Key Point:** "Hierarchy is never the same" across countries. What works in one country doesn't work in another.

---

### 13. Finance Department

**Finance (Inside Company):**
- Budget management
- Travel expenses
- Sales tracking
- Profit calculation
- Cash flow management
- Not about stock market - about internal company finances

**Purpose:** Manage money flow within the company to ensure profitability.

---

### 14. Business Goals

**Primary Goal:** Profit/Profitability

**Key Principle:** "Any business, tell me what they're looking for, if it's not profit."

- If you make money, you're successful
- If you don't make money, you're not successful
- Profit drives all business decisions
