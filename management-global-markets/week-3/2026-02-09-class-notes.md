**Why Phase 3 is Most Dangerous:**
- When you conceive (Phase 1), you're just looking at the market
- When you execute (Phase 2), you're moving and planting
- **Phase 3:** You're seeing the market, moving plant, associating with governments

- Everything fails after Phase 3 if not done correctly

**Key Insight:** Phase 3 requires patience and careful execution. Many companies fail here.
