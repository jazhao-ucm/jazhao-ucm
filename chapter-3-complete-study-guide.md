## **The Big Picture: Why Companies Go Global**

Companies expand to other countries to make more money, find new customers, and grow. But each country is different - different economies, laws, cultures, and people. So they need STRATEGIES to succeed.

This is all about understanding:
1. **Where to go** (which countries are good for business?)
2. **How to enter** (franchise? partnership? build from scratch?)
3. **How to adapt** (what do we need to change about our product/service?)

---

## **PART 1: EVALUATING MARKETS - Where Should We Go?**

When deciding which countries to enter, companies look at **4 main factors:**

### **Factor 1: Economic Indicators (GDP & Population)**

#### **GDP Per Capita**
- **What it means:** Average income per person in that country
- **Why it matters:** Richer countries = people can afford to buy your product
- **Example:** Australia's high GDP = people can afford restaurants, fancy products, entertainment
- **Strategy consideration:** Don't open luxury brands in poor countries; don't open budget brands only in rich countries

#### **GDP Growth Rate**
- **What it means:** Is the country's economy growing or shrinking?
- **Why it matters:** Growing economy = future opportunity. Shrinking = risky
- **Example:** China's high growth = investors piled in, knowing future profits would be huge
- **Strategy consideration:** Sometimes you invest in growing markets NOW to capture market share LATER, even if profits are low today

#### **Population**
- **What it means:** Total number of people living there
- **Why it matters:** More people = bigger potential customer base
- **Example:** India has 1.4 billion people. Even if only 10% can afford your product, that's 140 million customers!
- **Strategy consideration:** Small rich country vs. large poor country - which is better? (Usually depends on your brand)

**Real-world example:** Netflix looked at high-growth countries like India before they could afford subscriptions, betting they'd grow into customers.

---

### **Factor 2: Country Risk (Political & Economic Stability)**

#### **What is Country Risk?**
The likelihood that something BAD will happen that hurts your business:
- Government collapse or coup
- Economic crisis (currency collapse, inflation)
- Wars or civil unrest
- Sudden policy changes that hurt business

#### **Why it matters:**
Your restaurant could be forced to close overnight. Your investment vanishes. Customers disappear.

#### **Examples:**
- **High risk:** Venezuela (inflation, instability), Syria (war), Myanmar (political upheaval)
- **Low risk:** Canada, Switzerland, Germany (stable governments, predictable laws)

#### **Strategy implications:**
- High-risk countries might have HUGE profit potential but also huge risk of total failure
- Some companies avoid them completely
- Some companies enter only through partners who know the local system
- Some companies wait until risk decreases

**Real-world example:** Many Western companies pulled out of Russia after 2022 invasion, losing billions.

---

### **Factor 3: Trade Barriers & Tariffs (Cost of Doing Business)**

#### **What is a Tariff?**
A tax the government puts on imported goods. It makes foreign products more expensive.

**Simple example:**
- Your restaurant wants to import hamburger buns from your home country
- Import tariff = 20%
- Buns cost $1.00 normally → Now cost $1.20
- Your food costs more → Customers pay more → You sell fewer burgers

#### **Why it matters:**
High tariffs = higher costs = lower profits = might not be worth entering that market

#### **Smart strategy:**
- Source ingredients LOCALLY to avoid tariffs (even if quality is different)
- Franchise model instead of import model
- Partner with local companies who already have supply chains

**Real-world example:** Harley-Davidson wanted to export motorcycles to India but tariffs made them too expensive, so they partnered with local manufacturers.

---

### **Factor 4: Industry Rivalry (Competition)**

#### **What it means:**
How many competitors are already in that market? How intense is competition?

#### **Why it matters:**
- Too much competition = hard to get customers = hard to make money
- No competition = either a huge opportunity OR no market exists (bad sign)
- Moderate competition = customers already want the product, but you need to be better/cheaper/different

#### **Types of rivalry:**
- **High rivalry:** Crowded market, price wars, everyone fighting for customers
- **Low rivalry:** Less competition, but maybe less customer demand too

#### **Strategy implications:**
- **High rivalry:** You need a strong differentiation (better, cheaper, healthier, cooler)
- **Low rivalry:** You need to educate customers on why they want your product
- Sometimes you avoid high-rivalry markets, sometimes you enter them with a unique angle

**Real-world example:** Starbucks entered many developed countries with HIGH coffee shop competition but won by creating a "third place" experience (not home, not work).

---

## **PART 2: UNDERSTANDING CULTURE - How Do People Think & Behave?**

Economics only tells you if there's MONEY in the market. Culture tells you if customers will WANT your product and how to sell it to them.

### **What is Culture?**
Shared beliefs, values, and ways of doing things that make a group unique.

**Simple version:** It's "how we do things here" and "what we believe matters."

Culture affects EVERYTHING:
- What people buy
- How people shop
- What services they value
- How they like to be treated
- What's offensive vs. acceptable
- Family structures and decision-making

### **Geert Hofstede's 6 Cultural Dimensions**

A Dutch researcher studied 100,000+ people across 50+ countries and found that cultures differ on 6 main dimensions. Companies use this to adapt their strategy.

#### **DIMENSION 1: Power Distance Index (PDI) - Equality vs. Hierarchy**

**What it measures:** How much do people accept unequal power distribution?

**High Power Distance:**
- Society has clear hierarchy (bosses, workers, peasants)
- Those at the top have more power, privileges, and respect
- Those at the bottom accept this as normal
- **Examples:** Malaysia, Mexico, India, Philippines
- **Workplace:** Formal, respect authority, don't question boss
- **Culture markers:** Fancy titles, formal dress, CEO gets special treatment

**Low Power Distance:**
- Society is relatively flat, everyone somewhat equal
- Power should be justified and limited
- People can question authority
- **Examples:** Denmark, Austria, Australia, USA
- **Workplace:** Casual, call boss by first name, can suggest ideas
- **Culture markers:** Simple titles, casual dress, CEO eats in same cafeteria as workers

#### **Business Strategy Implications:**

**For high power distance countries:**
- Marketing should emphasize status and prestige
- Products for executives are premium, for workers are budget
- Hierarchical organization structure works better
- Leadership from the top is expected
- **Example:** Mercedes succeeds in high power distance countries; it signals status
- **Restaurant example:** Formal service, chef is highly respected authority

**For low power distance countries:**
- Marketing should emphasize equality and fairness
- Service should be egalitarian ("We're all on the same team")
- Participative management works better
- Leadership from collaboration is expected
- **Example:** IKEA succeeds in low power distance countries; it's simple and equal
- **Restaurant example:** Casual service, friendly staff, open kitchen where you see the cook

---

#### **DIMENSION 2: Individualism vs. Collectivism (INV) - Me vs. We**

**What it measures:** Do people prioritize themselves or the group?

**Individualistic:**
- "It's about ME and my immediate family"
- Personal goals come first
- Independence is valued
- Rights matter more than duties
- **Examples:** USA, Australia, UK, Canada, Netherlands
- **Workplace:** You work for your own career, personal achievement celebrated
- **Consumer behavior:** "What do I want?" "What's best for me?"

**Collectivistic:**
- "It's about OUR group/family/company/country"
- Group harmony comes first
- Interdependence is valued
- Duties matter more than rights
- **Examples:** China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Guatemala
- **Workplace:** You work for the company/team, group success celebrated
- **Consumer behavior:** "What does my family want?" "What's best for us?"

#### **Business Strategy Implications:**

**For individualistic countries:**
- Marketing focuses on personal benefits and personal achievement
- "Be yourself," "Follow your dreams," "You deserve it"
- Products emphasize personal choice and customization
- Advertising shows individuals succeeding
- **Examples:** "Have it your way" (Burger King), "Just Do It" (Nike)
- **Restaurant example:** Flexible menus, "build your own bowl," customization valued

**For collectivistic countries:**
- Marketing focuses on family and group harmony
- "Bring your family," "Share with loved ones," "tradition"
- Products emphasize group benefits and harmony
- Advertising shows families/groups together
- **Examples:** Family meal packages, group discounts
- **Restaurant example:** Family-style service (shared dishes), emphasis on togetherness, traditional recipes

---

#### **DIMENSION 3: Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS) - Competition vs. Cooperation**

**What it measures:** Does the culture value achievement/competition or relationships/cooperation?

**Masculine (Achievement-oriented):**
- Success = money, status, power
- Competition is good
- Big wins are celebrated
- "Live to work" mentality
- Achievement over relationships
- **Examples:** Japan, Austria, Venezuela, Italy

- **Values:** Ambitious, strong, decisive

**Feminine (Cooperation-oriented):**
- Success = good relationships, quality of life, helping others
- Cooperation is good
- Caring for others is celebrated
- "Work to live" mentality
- Relationships over achievement
- **Examples:** Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway), Costa Rica
- **Workplace:** Collaborative, group recognition, rewards for cooperation
- **Values:** Modest, soft-spoken, caring

#### **Business Strategy Implications:**

**For masculine cultures:**
- Marketing emphasizes success, status, winning, being the best
- Products position as premium, exclusive, for winners
- Competition and achievement are motivating
- **Examples:** Luxury brands, sports marketing, competition-based games
- **Restaurant example:** Expensive, exclusive, status symbol, "best steaks in the city"

**For feminine cultures:**
- Marketing emphasizes relationships, quality of life, caring
- Products position as good for family/community, sustainable, ethical
- Cooperation and harmony are motivating
- **Examples:** Fair-trade products, eco-friendly brands, community programs
- **Restaurant example:** Casual, family-friendly, locally sourced ingredients, cozy atmosphere, staff treated well

---

#### **DIMENSION 4: Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI) - Risk vs. Safety**

**What it measures:** How comfortable are people with risk and change?

**High Uncertainty Avoidance:**
- Avoid risk and change
- Prefer rules, structure, clear procedures
- "We've always done it this way"
- Tradition and security matter
- Anxiety about the unknown
- **Examples:** Japan, France, Greece, Belgium
- **Workplace:** Clear rules, formal procedures, long-term employment
- **Consumer behavior:** Stick with known brands, try new things slowly

**Low Uncertainty Avoidance:**
- Comfortable with risk and change
- Prefer flexibility, improvisation, adaptability
- "Let's try something new"
- Innovation and adventure matter
- Excited about the unknown
- **Examples:** Singapore, Jamaica, Denmark, USA, Australia
- **Workplace:** Flexible rules, experimentation encouraged, job-hopping is okay
- **Consumer behavior:** Try new brands, early adopters of new products

#### **Business Strategy Implications:**

**For high uncertainty avoidance cultures:**
- Marketing emphasizes safety, security, tried-and-true
- "Trusted since 1920," "Quality guaranteed," "Thousands of satisfied customers"
- Innovation should be slow and explained carefully
- Products need clear instructions and warranties
- **Examples:** Traditional banks succeed, new fintech struggles
- **Restaurant example:** Classic menu, "authentic" recipes, established reputation, staff uniforms, structured service

**For low uncertainty avoidance cultures:**
- Marketing emphasizes innovation, newness, adventure
- "Try something new," "Be a pioneer," "First to market"
- Change is celebrated
- Products with cutting-edge features appeal
- **Examples:** Tech startups, new trendy restaurants, experimental products
- **Restaurant example:** Fusion cuisine, molecular gastronomy, changing menu, casual atmosphere, experimentation valued

---

#### **DIMENSION 5: Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (LTO) - Future vs. Now**

**What it measures:** Do people focus on long-term goals or short-term gratification?

**Long-Term Orientation:**
- Think about the future
- Save money, invest in education
- Patience and persistence valued
- Adapt to circumstances
- Relationships (building trust) take time
- **Examples:** China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
- **Workplace:** Long-term career building, company loyalty, investing in training
- **Consumer behavior:** Buy quality items that last, willing to wait for results

- Fast ROI expected
- Trend-based marketing
- **Examples:** Fast fashion, quick-service restaurants, trendy bars
- **Restaurant example:** New concepts, Instagram-worthy food, limited-time offers, constant menu changes

---

#### **DIMENSION 6: Indulgence vs. Restraint - Fun vs. Discipline**

**What it measures:** How much does a culture value enjoying life vs. self-restraint?

**High Indulgence:**
- Life is for enjoying!
- Spend money on fun and pleasure
- Gratification is good
- Happiness and leisure valued
- **Examples:** Latin American countries, Australia, UK, USA
- **Behavior:** Eat out frequently, vacation spending, entertainment industry thrives

**High Restraint (Low Indulgence):**
- Discipline first
- Save money, control desires
- Self-restraint is good
- Duty and work valued more than fun
- **Examples:** East Asian countries, Middle Eastern countries
- **Behavior:** Less eating out, less leisure spending, work comes first

#### **Business Strategy Implications:**

**For high indulgence cultures:**
- Food and leisure industries THRIVE
- Restaurants, bars, entertainment venues are packed
- Spending on "fun" is normal and accepted

- Health and nutrition matter more
- Spending should have a purpose (not just fun)
- **Examples:** Efficient, functional products, education-focused
- **Restaurant strategy:** Value for money, health-conscious options, family meals, occasional treats

---

### **CULTURAL DISTANCE - The Hidden Challenge**

When entering a new market, calculate the **cultural distance** between your home country and the target country. It's the sum of differences across all 6 dimensions.

**Why it matters:**
- **Small cultural distance:** Customers think like you, marketing works easily, staff understands
- **Large cultural distance:** Everything needs translation, misunderstandings happen, takes longer to succeed

**Examples:**
- USA to Canada = tiny cultural distance (very similar)
- USA to Japan = massive cultural distance (very different on most dimensions)
- USA to UK = small cultural distance (similar, but some differences in formality/humor)

**Business implication:** Companies sometimes enter culturally-similar countries first to build experience, then tackle bigger cultural distances.

**Real example:** When McDonald's went to Japan, they had to adapt everything: portion sizes smaller, rice burger instead of beef burger for some menu items, more formal service, harmony in marketing instead of individual achievement.

---

## **PART 3: OPERATIONAL FACTORS - How Do They Do Business?**

Beyond broad culture, companies need to understand practical business customs.

### **Customs & Traditions - How Business Gets Done**

Different countries have different business etiquette and social norms.

#### **Example: How Meetings Start in Different Countries**

| Country | Time Before Starting | What Happens |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| Germany | 0-2 mins | Formal introduction, sit down, begin |
| Finland | 3-5 mins | Formal intro, coffee, then begin |
| USA | 2-3 mins | Informal hello, some small talk, begin |
| UK | 8-10 mins | Formal intro, tea, small talk about weather, then begin |
| France | 12-15 mins | Formal intro, discussion about politics/current events, then begin |
| Japan | 15-20 mins | Formal protocol, tea ceremony, let the senior person signal start |
| Spain/Italy | 20-30 mins | Informal, lots of small talk, waiting for others, very flexible on timing |

**What this teaches us:**
- German business = fast, efficient, no time-wasting
- UK business = relationship-building but reserved
- French business = intellectual discussion before trust
- Japanese business = protocol and respect matter first
- Italian business = personal relationships and warmth

#### **For restaurants/hospitality:**
- German customer = wants efficiency, quality, no pretense
- UK customer = appreciates politeness, proper service
- French customer = wants authentic food, discussion about quality
- Japanese customer = expects perfect service, respect personal space
- Italian customer = wants warmth, family atmosphere, personal connection

---

### **Behavioral Practices Affecting Business**

Within any culture, there are groups and sub-patterns:

#### **Group Affiliation**
- In collectivistic cultures, which group you belong to matters (family, company, social class)
- Business decisions involve the group, not just the individual

#### **Gender Groups**
- Some cultures have strong gender roles affecting business
- Example: In some Middle Eastern countries, women may need male approval for purchases
- Marketing must account for who makes decisions

#### **Age Groups**
- Some cultures respect age (elder knows best)
- Others value youth (young is innovative)
- Affects hiring, marketing, respect structures

#### **Family Structures**
- In some cultures, family-owned businesses are trusted
- In others, large corporations are trusted
- Affects how to brand yourself

#### **Languages**
- Not just translating words, but translating concepts
- Some ideas don't exist in other languages
- Marketing slogans can become embarrassing when translated
- **Famous failure:** Coca-Cola's original Chinese name sounded like "bite the wax tadpole"

---

### **Communication: Verbal vs. Non-Verbal**

Research shows that in face-to-face communication:
- **35% = What you say** (actual words/message)
- **65% = How you say it** (body language, tone, facial expressions)

**What counts as "how you say it"?**
- Facial expressions (smile, frown, eye contact)
- Tone of voice (enthusiastic, bored, angry)
- Gestures (hand movements, open/closed body)
- Posture (standing tall, slouching, leaning in)
- Movement (fidgeting, confident walking)
- Eye contact (varies by culture - more is better in some, disrespectful in others)

#### **For Business Strategy:**
- Your product's message matters less than HOW you present it
- In different cultures, "how" changes:
  - **Japan:** Modest, quiet, respectful tone
  - **USA:** Enthusiastic, confident, energetic tone
  - **Germany:** Professional, serious, no-nonsense tone
  - **Italy:** Passionate, expressive, animated tone

**Real example:** An American CEO's enthusiasm and big gestures might seem unprofessional in Japan but perfect in Brazil.

---

### **Religion & Food Practices**

Major world religions (~6 billion people):
- **Christianity:** ~2.4 billion (mostly USA, Europe, Latin America, Africa)
- **Islam:** ~1.9 billion (Middle East, North Africa, Southeast Asia, Indonesia)
- **Hinduism:** ~1.2 billion (India, Nepal)
- **Buddhism:** ~530 million (Southeast Asia, East Asia)
- **Judaism:** ~16 million (USA, Israel, Europe)

#### **For Food Business, Religion Creates Constraints:**

**Halal (Islam):**
- No pork, no alcohol
- Meat must be slaughtered in specific way
- Growing market: 1.9 billion potential customers
- **Business opportunity:** Halal certification opens huge market

**Kosher (Judaism):**
- No pork, shellfish, mixing meat with dairy
- More niche market but growing
- Premium positioning often

**Vegetarian/Vegan (Hinduism, Buddhism):**
- Respect for animal life
- Huge vegetarian populations in India
- **Business opportunity:** Plant-based options essential

**Holy Days:**
- Ramadan (Islam) = fasting during day, eating at night
- Christmas/Easter (Christianity) = family meals, gift-giving
- Diwali (Hinduism) = family celebrations
- **Business impact:** Predict when customers want to eat out

#### **Business Strategy:**
- Understand religious dietary restrictions in your market
- Don't accidentally offend (pork at Halal restaurant = disaster)
- Position products to fit religious values
- Time promotions around religious holidays

---

## **PART 4: THE ADAPTATION CHALLENGE - Culture Shock & Change**

When companies or people enter a new cultural environment, they go through predictable emotional phases.

### **The Acculturation Curve: 4 Phases of Adaptation**

#### **Phase 1: Euphoria** 😍
- **Duration:** Days to weeks
- **What it is:** Everything is new and exciting!
- **Feelings:** "I love it here! Everything is amazing! The food, the people, the culture!"
- **Reality:** You're in tourist mode, seeing only the positive

#### **Phase 2: Culture Shock** 😫
- **Duration:** Weeks to months (THIS IS THE HARDEST PHASE)
- **What it is:** Everything is confusing, strange, and frustrating
- **Feelings:** "Why do they do everything so differently? This makes no sense! I want to go home!"
- **Examples:**
  - Food tastes weird
  - People seem unfriendly (but they're just less expressive)
  - Business meetings take forever (but they're building relationships)
  - Rules aren't like home
- **Danger:** Many people quit or fail during this phase
- **Reality:** You're realizing how different things actually are

#### **Phase 3: Acculturation** 😐 → 😊
- **Duration:** Weeks to months (slow improvement)
- **What it is:** You're starting to understand and adapt
- **Feelings:** "Okay, I'm getting it. This makes sense now. It's not better or worse, just different."
- **Examples:**
  - You start eating local food and enjoying it
  - You realize the slow business meetings are actually building trust
  - You make local friends
  - You speak the language better
- **Reality:** You're learning the "why" behind what seems strange

#### **Phase 4: Stable State** 😄
- **Duration:** Months onward
- **What it is:** It feels normal. You've adapted.
- **Feelings:** "This is home now. I might actually prefer how they do some things."
- **Outcomes:** Three possible endings:
  - **Even be better:** You love it MORE than home. You don't want to leave.
  - **Good as before:** You're equally happy as you were at home.
  - **Remain negative:** You never adapted. You're still frustrated. (Rare if you made it through phase 3)

### **Key Insight:**
This happens to EVERYONE entering a new culture. It's not a personal failure - it's a normal process. The key is not quitting during phase 2.

### **For Companies:**
- Prepare expatriate employees for culture shock
- Expect slow progress in new markets (don't judge on year 1)
- Have support systems for employees
- Recognize that adaptation takes time

---

## **PART 5: CULTURAL EMPATHY - The Secret Weapon**

### **What is Cultural Empathy?**
Understanding that other cultures' ways of doing things make sense IN THEIR CONTEXT, even if they're different from yours.

**It's NOT:**
- Agreeing with everything they do
- Changing yourself completely
- Thinking they're right and you're wrong

**It IS:**
- Respecting that their way works for them
- Understanding the "why" behind different practices
- Being open to learning
- Recognizing that different ≠ wrong

### **Why It Matters for Business:**
- **More sales:** Customers buy from people/companies that respect them
- **Better employees:** Staff work harder for managers who respect their culture
- **Less conflict:** Misunderstandings decrease when you understand each other
- **Better adaptations:** You make smarter decisions about what to change and what to keep

### **Real Examples of Lacking Cultural Empathy (FAILURES):**

- **Starbucks in Italy:** Opened coffee shops in the home of espresso culture. Italians were offended. Starbucks had to adapt their approach.
- **Uber in Japan:** Didn't understand that Japanese drivers take pride in their vehicles and service. Struggled until they adapted.
- **Netflix in India:** Tried to use US content. Failed until they invested in Indian-made content.

### **Real Examples with Cultural Empathy (SUCCESSES):**

- **McDonald's in India:** Realized cows are sacred. Removed beef. Added vegetarian options. Success!
- **IKEA in China:** Studied how Chinese families live. Designed show rooms reflecting Chinese homes. Big success.
- **L'Oreal in Japan:** Understood Japanese preference for lighter skin tones. Didn't try to change the preference; adapted products. Success!

## **PART 6: THE THREE STRATEGIC APPROACHES TO GOING GLOBAL**

### **Strategy 1: Globalization (Think Global)**
- Same product, same marketing everywhere
- "Our way is best; everyone should want it"
- **Works when:** Product is truly universal (Coca-Cola, Apple)
- **Fails when:** Cultural differences matter to customers
- **Risk:** Offends local cultures, doesn't adapt

### **Strategy 2: Localization (Act Local)**
- Completely change product and marketing for each country
- "We'll be just like the locals"
- **Works when:** You have time and money to fully adapt
- **Fails when:** You lose your brand identity
- **Risk:** Too different from home; very expensive

### **Strategy 3: Glocalization (Think Global, Act Local) ✅ BEST APPROACH**
- Keep core brand identity but adapt to local culture
- "We're a global brand, but we respect your culture"
- **Example:** McDonald's has the same golden arches everywhere but menu changes per country:
  - USA: Beef burgers
  - India: Chicken/veggie (no beef)
  - Japan: Rice burgers
  - Middle East: Halal meat
- **Works when:** Customers want your brand BUT adapted to them
- **Why it's best:** Balances global efficiency with local relevance

---

## **PART 7: REAL ADVICE FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SUCCESS**

### ✅ DO:

**Before entering a market:**
- Research GDP, growth, and population (Is there money there?)
- Assess country risk (Will it be stable?)
- Understand tariffs and trade barriers (Will costs be too high?)
- Analyze competition (Can we win?)
- Study all 6 cultural dimensions (How do they think?)

**When operating:**
- Learn local customs and business etiquette
- Understand how religion/food practices affect your business
- Communicate clearly (non-verbal matters more than verbal)
- Show cultural empathy - respect differences
- Be patient with culture shock phases (yours and your team's)
- Adapt strategically (glocalization, not full change)

**On the ground:**
- Hire local staff who understand the culture
- Learn enough language to show respect
- Build relationships before doing business (especially in high power distance cultures)
- Follow local customs even if you don't fully understand them yet
- Ask questions respectfully

### ❌ DON'T:

- Assume your home country way is the only right way
- Ignore economic indicators and think you can succeed anyway
- Enter high-risk markets without a plan
- Set prices without understanding purchasing power
- Translate marketing slogans directly (it gets weird)
- Pressure people to adapt to YOUR culture
- Ignore religious or cultural food restrictions
- Expect quick success (adaptation takes time)
- Judge another culture as "backward" or "weird"

### ❌ MISTAKES COMPANIES MAKE:

- **Coca-Cola in China:** Original name translated to "bite the wax tadpole" - changed it
- **KFC in China:** Tried using a western image - adapted to show cleanliness/modernity (worked)
- **Disney in France:** Treated it like USA theme park - failed because French wanted European culture respected
- **Facebook in China:** Refused to follow censorship rules - got banned completely
- **Google in China:** Same issue - eventually left

### ✅ COMPANIES THAT GOT IT RIGHT:

- **IKEA:** Studies local families, designs for their spaces, not forcing Swedish style
- **Netflix:** Produces LOCAL shows (Squid Game is Korean, made huge money)
- **Airbnb:** Respects local housing cultures, doesn't try to American-ize everywhere
- **Nestle:** Massive food company that respects religious dietary laws, local tastes
- **Samsung:** Korean company respected locally in each market while maintaining global brand

---

## **THE BOTTOM LINE**

Going international isn't about making everyone want your home country's way. It's about:

1. **Understanding** the economic opportunity (money, growth, customers)
2. **Analyzing** the business environment (risk, competition, costs)
3. **Respecting** the culture (values, beliefs, customs)
4. **Adapting** smartly (keeping your core identity while respecting local needs)
5. **Building** relationships (cultural empathy, patience, respect)
6. **Executing** patiently (culture shock is normal, adaptation takes time)

**The winning formula:** *Think Global. Act Local. Respect Culture.*

This is why successful international companies aren't just selling products - they're building relationships with new cultures. 🌍
