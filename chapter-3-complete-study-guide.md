# Globalization, Glocalization & Slowbalization: Market Entry
## Super Simple Notes

---

## **The Game: What You're Doing**
You're managing a restaurant chain going international. You pick a home country, then decide which other countries to open restaurants in over 6 years. Think of it like Monopoly, but with countries instead of streets.

---

## **Part 1: Money Stuff (GDP & Population)**

### GDP Per Capita
- **What it means:** How much money the average person in a country makes
- **Why it matters:** Rich countries = people can afford to eat out more often
- **Example:** Australia has high GDP per capita, so more people there can afford casual dining

### GDP Growth
- **What it means:** Is the country getting richer or poorer?
- **Why it matters:** Fast-growing countries = future customers = good place to open restaurant

### Population
- **What it means:** How many people live there
- **Why it matters:** More people = more potential customers

**Bottom line:** Look for countries where people have money NOW and the country is getting richer LATER.

---

## **Part 2: Risk & Competition**

### Country Risk
- **What it means:** How unstable is the country? Could the government change, economy crash, or wars happen?
- **Simple version:** Is it a safe place to do business?
- **Why it matters:** Risky countries = your restaurant might fail due to things you can't control

### Trade Barriers (Tariffs)
- **What it means:** Taxes the government puts on imported stuff
- **Simple version:** "You want to bring ingredients from home? That'll cost extra!"
- **Why it matters:** High tariffs = your ingredients cost more = your food costs more = fewer customers

### Industry Rivalry
- **What it means:** How many other restaurants are already there?
- **Simple version:** How crowded is the market?
- **Why it matters:** Too many competitors = hard to succeed

---

## **Part 3: Culture (The BIGGEST Part)**

### What is Culture?
The shared beliefs, values, and habits that make a group of people unique. It's "how we do things here."

### Geert Hofstede's 6 Dimensions
This Dutch guy studied 100,000+ people and found 6 ways cultures differ:

#### **1. Power Distance (PDI)**
**High Power Distance:**
- Boss is the boss. You don't question them.
- Big gap between CEO and janitor
- Example countries: Countries with strict hierarchy

**Low Power Distance:**
- Everyone is equal-ish
- You can talk to your boss casually
- Example countries: Scandinavian countries

**For restaurants:** High power distance = formal service. Low power distance = casual service.

---

#### **2. Individualism (INV)**
**Individualistic:**
- It's all about YOU and your family
- "I want what I want"
- Example: USA, Australia

**Collectivistic:**
- We're all in this together
- "What's good for the group?"
- Example: China, India

**For restaurants:** Individualistic = flexible menus, "have it your way." Collectivistic = family meals, shared dishes.

---

#### **3. Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS)**
**Masculine:**
- Success = money and power
- Competitive, aggressive
- Example: Japan, USA

**Feminine:**
- Success = good relationships
- Caring, cooperative
- Example: Nordic countries

**For restaurants:** Masculine = fancy, status symbol. Feminine = cozy family place.

---

#### **4. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI)**
**High Uncertainty Avoidance:**
- "We've always done it this way"
- Rules and traditions matter
- Uncomfortable with change
- Example: Japan, France

**Low Uncertainty Avoidance:**
- "Let's try something new!"
- Flexible, adventurous
- Example: USA, Australia

**For restaurants:** High UAI = stick to traditional menu. Low UAI = experiment with fusion food.

---

#### **5. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (LTO)**
**Long-Term:**
- Think about the future
- Save money, invest in growth
- Example: China

**Short-Term:**
- Think about right now
- Enjoy today
- Example: USA

**For restaurants:** Long-term = focus on stability. Short-term = focus on trendy, fun stuff.

---

#### **6. Indulgence**
**High Indulgence:**
- "Life is for enjoying!"
- People buy fun stuff, eat out more
- Example: Latin America

**Low Indulgence (Restraint):**
- "Discipline first"
- People save, don't spend much on fun
- Example: East Asian countries

**For restaurants:** High indulgence = MORE CUSTOMERS (they love eating out)!

---

### **Cultural Distance**
Think of it like a score. Compare your home country to a target country on all 6 dimensions. The bigger the difference, the harder it is to do business there because:
- You don't understand how people think
- Your marketing won't work
- Customers won't "get" your restaurant

**Easy version:** Small cultural distance = customers understand you better = easier to succeed.

---

## **Part 4: Customs & Traditions**

Different countries have different ways of doing things:

### **Example: Starting a Meeting**
- **Germany:** Formal, get straight to business (0 mins)
- **Finland:** Formal, have coffee, then business (5 mins)
- **USA:** Informal, coffee, chit-chat, then business (3 mins)
- **UK:** Formal, tea and small talk about weather (10 mins)
- **France:** Formal, 15 mins of chatting about politics (15 mins)
- **Japan:** Super formal, tea, follow protocol, let the big guy start (20 mins)
- **Spain/Italy:** Very informal, small talk while waiting for everyone (30 mins)

**For restaurants:** You need to understand how people like to eat and socialize in that country.

---

## **Part 5: Communication**

### **The 35/65 Rule**
- **35% = What you say** (actual words)
- **65% = How you say it** (body language, facial expressions, tone)

**Simple version:** "How you say it matters way more than what you say."

### **What counts as "how you say it"?**
- Facial expressions
- Tone of voice
- Gestures
- Eye contact
- Posture
- Movement

**For interviews/business:** Don't just say "I'm motivated" - SHOW it with enthusiasm, eye contact, and energy!

---

## **Part 6: Religion**

Major religions in the world:
- **Christianity:** ~2.4 billion people
- **Islam:** ~1.9 billion people
- **Hinduism:** ~1.2 billion people
- **Buddhism:** ~530 million people
- **Judaism:** ~16 million people

**Why it matters:**
- Some religions have food rules (Halal, Kosher, Vegetarian)
- Holy days affect when people want to eat out
- Values in religion affect what customers want

**For restaurants:** Respect food rules, know holiday calendars, understand values.

## **Culture Shock: The 4 Phases**

When you move to a new country, you go through emotional stages:

### **Phase 1: Euphoria** 😍
- Everything is AWESOME and new!
- "I love it here!"
- Duration: Days to weeks

### **Phase 2: Culture Shock** 😫
- Everything is WEIRD and annoying
- "Why do they do things this way?!"
- Food tastes weird, people act strange
- Duration: Weeks to months (WORST PHASE)

### **Phase 3: Acculturation** 😐➡️😊
- You're getting used to it
- Starting to understand why they do things
- Beginning to like it

### **Phase 4: Stable State** 😄
- It feels normal now
- You might even like their way better
- You're adapted!

**Key insight:** Everyone goes through this. It's normal. Stick with it!

---

## **Cultural Empathy**

### **What it means:**
Understanding and appreciating how other people's culture is different from yours - NOT because it's weird, but because it makes sense in THEIR context.

### **Why it matters:**
- More tolerant of differences
- Better at business across cultures
- Happier life overall
- Better employee/manager

**Simple version:** Just because something is different doesn't mean it's wrong. Try to understand WHY they do it.

---

## **The Bottom Line: How to Succeed in New Markets**

### ✅ DO:
- Study GDP, growth, and population (who can afford you?)
- Check country risk (is it stable?)
- Understand cultural dimensions (how do they think?)
- Learn customs and traditions (how do they do things?)
- Watch your communication (show enthusiasm, not just tell)
- Respect religions and food rules
- Be prepared for culture shock in yourself and employees

### ❌ DON'T:
- Assume your home country way is the only way
- Ignore high tariffs and trade barriers
- Enter markets with too much competition without a plan
- Try to change a country's culture to match yours

### 🎯 REAL TALK:
Host countries don't always want you to change completely to their way. They might accept that you're different. BUT smart international companies look at what works in other cultures and bring those ideas back home.

## **Key Takeaway**

**Think Global, Act Local (Glocalization)**
- Keep your core brand identity
- But adapt to local culture, tastes, and traditions
- You're not trying to be just like everyone else - you're being SMART about serving different people

**That's the whole game!** 🍽️🌍
