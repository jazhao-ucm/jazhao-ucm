## About

Hi, I'm Jade. I'm an Informatics researcher and AI builder focused on creating technology that is accessible, ethical, and built *with* people — not *at* them.

I work across the full stack — research, product design, and development — and I'm constantly learning. My work has included supporting small businesses during the pandemic, developing AI-powered educational tools, and redesigning websites for organizations such as Middle Way House, Bloomington Chamber of Commerce, and Indiana Phenology Lab. The question that drives everything I build: **does this solve a real problem for real people?**

As a first-generation student, I think critically about who gets left out of the tech world. That perspective informs everything I build, from the first wireframe to the final deployment.

Currently based in Madrid, studying Strategic Management and Product Management at UCM — bringing a global lens to how I approach product design and development.

## Areas of Focus

### AI for Education
Developed adaptive learning tools that adjust pace and difficulty in real time based on student progress. Built AI tutoring systems designed to support English language learners and students with learning disabilities — at no cost, because access matters. Also designed systems that reduce administrative workload for advisors, freeing them to focus on what matters: the students.

### Healthcare Systems
Designed secure, real-time patient monitoring platforms that consolidate health data from multiple sources — doctor visits, fitness trackers, lab results — into one accessible interface. Built with women's health in focus, ensuring that people with limited healthcare access still feel empowered to understand and act on their own health data.

### Small Business Solutions
During the pandemic, helped 10+ small businesses establish an online presence by building websites, setting up marketing channels, and creating automation tools for scheduling, paperwork, and follow-ups. Also developed affordable AI systems to help businesses operate more efficiently without sacrificing the personal touch that makes them stand out.

### Student Support & Advising
Identified friction points in advising and resource discovery, then built guides that give students a clear, independent path forward. Consolidated scattered campus resources into a single accessible tool — designed with first-generation and low-income students in mind.
