## ✨ About Me
Hola! I’m **Jade**, an Informatics student at **Indiana University** (graduating **Spring 2027**) and a proud **Hudson & Holland Scholar**. I design and build **AI-powered, user-centered tools** that support healthcare, education, and small businesses—always with accessibility and ethics front and center.

I’m currently studying abroad in **Madrid 🇪🇸** at **Universidad Complutense de Madrid**, supported by the **Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship** and the **Hutton International Experiences Program Grant**. I’m exploring how different cultures approach technology and bringing those global perspectives into my AI and design work.

When I’m not coding or designing, you’ll find me café-hopping, blogging about ethical tech, or trying (and sometimes failing) to keep my jade plants alive 🌱
