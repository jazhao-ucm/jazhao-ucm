## ✍️ Study Tip: Write Handwritten Notes!

**📝 Important:** While these digital notes are comprehensive, **writing your own handwritten notes** will significantly improve your retention and understanding!

### Why Handwritten Notes Help:
- **Better Memory**: Writing by hand activates different parts of your brain, improving recall
- **Active Learning**: Forces you to process and summarize information in your own words
- **Personal Connection**: Your own handwriting creates a stronger memory connection
- **Focus**: Reduces distractions compared to typing on a device
- **Visual Memory**: The physical act of writing helps create spatial memory

### How to Use This Repository with Handwritten Notes:
1. **Read** the class notes and study guides here
2. **Write** your own handwritten summary in a notebook
3. **Compare** your notes with these materials to fill gaps
4. **Review** both your handwritten notes and these digital materials
5. **Create** diagrams, mind maps, and flashcards by hand

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use these digital notes as a reference, but make handwritten notes your primary study tool. The combination of both will maximize your learning and retention!

### CHAPTER 1: GLOBALIZATION, GLOCALIZATION, SLOWBALIZATION

**Key Definitions:**
- **Globalization**: Free movement of goods, services, capital across borders. Winners: China, India, Indonesia
- **Slowbalization**: Slowing down of globalization, countries becoming protectionist
- **Glocalization**: "Think global, act local" - adapting products for local markets

**Economic Complexity:**
- Transform raw materials → complex products using technology, innovation, R&D
- Top countries: USA, Britain, Netherlands, UK
- Innovation in technology = key difference

**Major Players:**
- **China**: Biggest exporter, massive population, cheap labor ($2/day)
- **USA**: Biggest importer, strong in software/technology
- **India**: Second largest population, high production
- **Indonesia**: Top 3 in GDP

**Demographics (Next 50-60 years):**
- **Africa**: Massive growth, will become dominant
- **Europe**: By 2032 = 400M people, 60% over age 60
- **Asia**: Will peak then decline

**G20**: 20 countries representing ~50% of global economy

### CHAPTER 2: CROSS-CULTURAL COMPETENCE

**Hofstede's 6 Dimensions:**
1. **Power Distance**: High (hierarchical) vs Low (equal)
2. **Individualism**: "I" vs Collectivism "We"
3. **Masculinity**: Success = money vs Femininity = relationships
4. **Uncertainty Avoidance**: High (rules) vs Low (flexible)
5. **Long-Term Orientation**: Future planning vs Short-term = present
6. **Indulgence**: Enjoy life vs Restraint = discipline

**Culture Shock - 4 Phases:**
1. Euphoria (excited)
2. Culture Shock (worst - want to leave) ← CRITICAL: Stay!
3. Acculturation (learning, adapting)
4. Stable State (comfortable)

**Communication - 35/65 Rule:**
- 35% = words, 65% = body language/tone/expressions
- How you say it matters MORE than what you say

**Cultural Distance**: Bigger distance = harder to do business

**Cannot Escape**: Culture and Communication (must adapt)

---

### CHAPTER 3: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY

**Market Entry Risks:**
- Cultural, Legal, Logistical, Financial, Market, Political

**Market Attractiveness:**
- GDP Growth, Population Growth, Political Risk Index

**Competition Strategy:**
- **GO WHERE COMPETITORS ARE** (don't avoid them!)
- Market validation, learning opportunity
- Need to differentiate yourself

**Product Quality:**
- **Japan**: Quality leader (expensive)
- **China**: Volume/repetition (cheaper)

**Global Supply Chain:**
- Containerization essential
- Parts from multiple countries → assembled in one place
- Nothing is 100% from one country anymore

**Localization Process:**
- Localization → Internationalization → Globalization

---

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

✅ Globalization slowing → Slowbalization  
✅ China/India dominate production/exports  
✅ Culture cannot be escaped - must adapt  
✅ Culture shock is normal - stick through Phase 2!  
✅ Communication: 65% non-verbal > 35% verbal  
✅ Go where competitors are (don't avoid them!)  
✅ Multiple risks when entering new markets  
✅ Everything is global - nothing 100% from one country  

**Essential Skills:** Language, Cultural Empathy, Respect, Communication, Risk Assessment

</details>

**📝 Action:** Copy the summary above onto physical paper by hand. Writing it yourself will dramatically improve your retention!
