## hey, i'm jade 

i'm an informatics student at indiana university (graduating spring 2027) and a hudson and holland scholar. i build ai tools, design human-centered tech, and help small businesses and organizations navigate digital challenges.

right now i'm studying abroad in madrid at universidad complutense de madrid, supported by the luddy study abroad scholarship and the hutton international experiences program grant. i came here to explore how different communities approach technology, to challenge my own assumptions, and to bring a more global perspective back to my work.

as a first-gen student, i think a lot about who technology is built for...and who gets left out. that question shapes everything i make.

when i'm not coding or designing, you'll find me café-hopping through madrid's historic center, writing about ethical tech, or trying (with mixed success) to keep my jade plants alive.
