## hey, i'm jade 

Hi, I'm Jade.

I'm an Informatics researcher and AI builder focused on accessible, ethical, practical technology that works for everyone...not just people who already understand it.

I've helped small businesses go online during the pandemic, developed AI tools for education, and redesigned websites for organizations like Middle Way House and Bloomington Chamber of Commerce. Across everything: does this solve a real problem for real people?

I work full stack...research, product design, development...and I'm currently expanding globally. Based in Madrid studying Strategic Management and Product Management at UCM, which has shaped how I approach building products with a broader perspective.

Outside work, I explore Madrid's cafés, write about ethical tech and AI's future, and keep my jade plants alive (still working on that last one).

## what i build

**ai development**
• Developed adaptive learning tools that adjust pace and difficulty in real time, with AI tutoring that simplifies concepts for English language learners and students with disabilities at no cost.

• Freed advisors from repetitive information tasks so they can spend more time actually helping students move forward.

**healthcare & monitoring**
• Consolidated health data from multiple sources (doctor visits, fitness trackers, lab results) into one secure platform, enabling care teams to access what matters without manual data entry or security risks.

• Built real-time monitoring that surfaces priority alerts and designed the system with women's health in focus, making health data understandable and actionable for people with limited healthcare access or health literacy.

**small business solutions**
• Helped small businesses get online during the pandemic by building websites and setting up marketing channels, then created automation tools to handle routine tasks like scheduling and paperwork so owners could focus on their actual work.

• Developed affordable AI systems that helped businesses generate ideas and work faster while keeping that personal touch that makes small businesses special.

**user-centered design**
• Mapped friction points in student advising and built guides that give students a clear, independent path forward, consolidating scattered campus resources into one accessible tool designed for first-generation and low-income students.

• Freed advisors from repetitive information tasks so they can spend more time actually helping students move forward.

**mentorship & impact**
