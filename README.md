# jadewowgreen (Madrid portfolio)

**Source of truth:** this repo publishes from the **root** on GitHub Pages, with the portfolio living in `site/`. Edit here, commit to `main`, and let Pages build from `/`.

**Live site:** [jadewowgreen.github.io/jadewowgreen/](https://jadewowgreen.github.io/jadewowgreen/)

## What this is

First-generation informatics student portfolio: **Madrid on Film**, Spring 2026 in Spain (Madrid, Segovia, Toledo, Tenerife). Episode-based narrative with a 20-episode arc (currently 12 published, placeholders through week 20), personal photos only, a **sounds like** line per episode (links open Spotify search for that track), tropical island art direction inspired by Weezer's "Island in the Sun", light vanilla JS.

The episode captions are intentionally short and single-line so the text stays calm beside the photo grid.

There is also a dynamic **Coming Soon** section that uses a fixed 20-week timeline and currently displays **week 12/20**, with placeholders for weeks 13 through 20.
