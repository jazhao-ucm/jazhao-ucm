## about me
i’m jade, an informatics student at indiana university (graduating spring 2027) and a hudson and holland scholar. happy year of the dragon. i build ai tools, design user-centered tech, and help small businesses/organizations adapt to digital challenges. my work focuses on the intersection of people, technology, and innovation...creating solutions that improve how people live, connect, and thrive.

as a first-gen student, i’m inspired by the lunar new year’s themes of renewal and community. this year, i’m studying abroad in madrid at universidad complutense de madrid (supported by the luddy study abroad scholarship and hutton international experiences program grant). here to explore how different communities approach tech, challenge my assumptions, and bring global perspectives back to my work.

when i’m not coding or designing, you’ll find me café-hopping, blogging about ethical tech, or trying (and sometimes failing) to keep my jade plants alive.
