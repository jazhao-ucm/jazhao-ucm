## hey, i'm jade 

Hi, I'm Jade.

I'm an Informatics researcher and AI builder obsessed with creating technology that's accessible, ethical, and real...technology built *with* people, not *at* them.

I've spent my time helping small businesses find their footing online, building AI tools that actually help students learn, and redesigning websites for organizations that matter (Middle Way House, Bloomington Chamber of Commerce, and others). The question that drives everything: **does this solve a real problem for real people?**

I work across the full stack...research, product design, development...and I'm constantly learning. Right now I'm in Madrid studying Strategic Management and Product Management at UCM, soaking up new perspectives on how different communities approach technology.

As a first-generation student, I think a lot about who gets left out of the tech world. That awareness shapes everything I build.

When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me exploring Madrid's café scene, writing about ethical tech, or keeping my jade plants alive (it's an ongoing journey).

If you're working on something where human-centered technology matters, I'd love to connect.

## iu life 

I'm an informatics student at Indiana University (graduating spring 2027) and a Hudson and Holland Scholar. I'm here because I genuinely care about building technology that serves *everyone*...especially those who might feel like the tech world wasn't built with them in mind.

As a peer mentor at the Office of Student Life, I get to help students find their footing and build confidence. There's something really special about being that person who believes in someone when they're doubting themselves. As a Handshake influencer, I work with IU Luddy career services to create resources that make career planning feel less scary and more achievable.

The Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship and Hutton International Experiences Program Grant brought me to Madrid this semester. I came here to challenge my own assumptions, learn how different communities approach technology, and bring those perspectives home.

## what i build

**ai for education** 
I develop adaptive learning tools that meet students where they are...adjusting pace and difficulty in real time based on actual progress. Built AI tutoring systems that simplify concepts for English language learners and students with learning disabilities at no cost, because access matters.

I also designed systems that help advisors spend less time on paperwork and more time doing what actually matters: sitting down with students and helping them move forward.

**healthcare systems** 
I've designed secure, real-time patient monitoring that brings together health data from different sources (doctor visits, fitness trackers, lab results) into one accessible platform. Everything's protected so only the right people see it, and the system flags what matters first so care teams can act faster.

I built these with women's health in focus, making sure people with limited healthcare access or unfamiliarity with their own data still feel empowered to understand and own their health information.

**small business solutions** 
During the pandemic, I helped small businesses stay alive by building websites, setting up marketing channels, and creating automation tools that handle the repetitive stuff (scheduling, paperwork, follow-ups). This freed owners to focus on what they actually love...their customers and their craft.

I also developed affordable AI systems that help businesses generate ideas and work faster while keeping that personal, human touch that makes small businesses special.

**student support & advising** 
I mapped the friction points where students get stuck...in advising, in finding resources, in figuring out what comes next...and built guides that give them a clear, independent path forward. I consolidated scattered campus resources into one accessible tool, designed specifically with first-generation and low-income students in mind.

Because I know what it's like to navigate without a support system at home.

**mentorship & community** 
As a peer mentor at the Office of Student Life, I support students in building confidence and finding their place. As a Handshake influencer, I developed AI-integrated career guides and resume workshops for 150+ students, with a focus on helping first-gen and underrepresented students feel truly empowered.

## recent projects

**ai career guide**
Led a team to build an AI-integrated career guide and resume workshop for 150+ IU students. We increased engagement by 45% and reached 50,000+ impressions. The goal was always accessibility...making sure every student, especially first-gen students, felt confident and supported.

**healthcare monitoring systems**
Designed secure, real-time patient monitoring using agentic AI. Built systems that safely pull together health data from different sources, protected so only the right people can see it, and flag what matters first so care teams can act faster and help their patients better.

**small business digital transition**
Helped 10+ small businesses get online during COVID. Built websites, set up marketing, and created smart tools that handle the repetitive stuff automatically...freeing up owners to focus on their customers and their craft.

**middle way house**
Redesigned their website with accessibility and user privacy at the center. I conducted interviews with survivors to inform every design choice, because their voices matter most.

**indiana phenology lab**
Collaborated on digital tools to support ecological research and community engagement. Focused on data visualization and user-friendly interfaces so researchers and volunteers could actually use and enjoy the tools.

**bloomington chamber of commerce**
Developed digital solutions to enhance local business connectivity and streamline member engagement. Supported economic growth in a community I care about.

## what i'm focused on rn 

This semester in Madrid, I'm diving deep into product management and strategic thinking to bring a more global lens to how I build. I'm fascinated by Spain's fintech innovations and how they could inspire ethical, scalable solutions for small businesses everywhere.

I'm also slowly improving my Spanish (muy lentamente, but we're getting there) and embracing bold, creative projects that scare me a little.

Mostly though? I'm learning, growing, and building things that actually matter to real people.

## let's connect 

I'm always open to collaborations, wild ideas, feedback, or just chatting about ethical tech, AI, the future we're building, or the best cafés in Madrid (spoiler: there are so many).
