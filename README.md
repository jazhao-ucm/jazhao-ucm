## About Me
Hola! I’m **Jade**, an informática student at **Indiana University** (graduating **Spring 2027**) and a **Hudson & Holland Scholar**. I design and build **AI-powered, user-centered tools** for healthcare, education, and small businesses, with a strong focus on accessibility and ethical technology.

I’m currently studying abroad in **Madrid** at **Universidad Complutense de Madrid**, supported by the **Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship** and the **Hutton International Experiences Program Grant**. Through this experience, I’m exploring how different communities approach technology and incorporating global perspectives into my AI and design work.

Outside of academics and projects, I enjoy café-hopping, writing about ethical tech, and trying (and sometimes failing) to keep my jade plants alive.
