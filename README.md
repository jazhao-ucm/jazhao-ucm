## About
Hi! I’m Jade — an informatics student at Indiana University, graduating **Spring 2027**, and a **Hudson & Holland Scholar**. I build AI-powered tools, design user-centered technology, and help small businesses and organizations navigate digital transformation. My work focuses on creating ethical, accessible solutions that improve how people live, connect, and thrive.

I’m currently studying abroad in **Madrid** at *Universidad Complutense de Madrid*, supported by the **Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship** and the **Hutton International Experiences Program Grant**. I’m exploring how different communities approach technology and bringing global perspectives back into my design and AI work.

When I’m not coding or designing, you’ll probably find me café-hopping, blogging about ethical tech, or trying (and sometimes failing) to keep my jade plants alive 🌱
