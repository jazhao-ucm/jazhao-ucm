## About

Hi, I'm Jade. I'm studying Informatics at Indiana University and I build things ... mostly tools for education and healthcare. I'm still learning (always will be), but I love working on projects that actually make a difference for people.

Being a first-generation student means I've seen firsthand who gets left behind in tech. That perspective shapes how I build things. When I'm designing something, I'm thinking about the person who might not have the same resources or support I did.

Right now I'm in Madrid studying Strategic Management and Product Management at UCM. It's been eye-opening to see how different cultures approach product design and business strategy. Plus, the tapas are incredible.

## What I Work On

### Education
I build learning tools and tutoring systems, mostly for English language learners and students with learning disabilities. I've also built automation tools to help advisors cut down on paperwork so they can spend more time with students.

### Healthcare
I build platforms that bring together health data from different sources ... doctor visits, fitness trackers, lab results ... into one place that actually makes sense. I focus a lot on women's health and making sure people who don't have great healthcare access can still understand and use their own health information.

### Small Business Solutions
During COVID, I helped a bunch of small businesses figure out how to exist online. I built websites, set up marketing, and created automation tools for scheduling and follow-ups. The challenge was making things efficient without losing that personal touch that makes small businesses special.

### Student Support & Advising
I build tools to help students navigate campus life and find resources. I always start by talking to students to understand what's confusing or overwhelming. Then I build guides and tools to make things clearer. I especially think about first-generation and low-income students because I know how hard it can be to figure things out when you don't have someone at home who's been through it.

## Projects

### Career Guide
I led a team to build a career guide and resume workshop for IU students. We made it accessible, especially for first-gen students who might not have as much support navigating career stuff. It's currently being used at IU Luddy Career Services.

### Healthcare Monitoring Platform
I built a platform that brings together health data from different sources. The whole point was to make it so people with limited healthcare access could actually understand their own health information. I focused a lot on women's health because there's such a gap there. It's still a work in progress, but I'm excited about where it's going.

### Small Business Digital Transition
During COVID, I helped about 10 small businesses figure out how to go online. I built websites, set up marketing automation, and created tools for scheduling and follow-ups. I learned a lot about what small businesses actually need versus what tech people think they need.

### Middle Way House
I redesigned their website with accessibility and privacy at the center. Before I started designing anything, I talked to survivors to understand what they actually needed. That conversation changed how I approached the project.

### Indiana Phenology Lab
I worked on digital tools for ecological research. I built data visualizations and interfaces that worked for both researchers and volunteers. The challenge was making complex ecological data accessible to people who aren't scientists, which was fun to figure out.

### Bloomington Chamber of Commerce
I built digital solutions to help local businesses connect better and streamline how they engage with members. It was cool to work on something that directly impacts the local community I was part of.

## Currently

I'm in Madrid studying Strategic Management and Product Management at UCM, which has been amazing. I'm learning a lot about product strategy and how different cultures approach business. I'm really interested in fintech innovation here ... I've been exploring how some models emerging in Spain could translate to small businesses back home. There's something cool about taking ideas from one place and seeing if they work in another context.

I'm always learning new tools and techniques. Things move fast, so sometimes I feel like I'm just trying to keep up, but I think the key is to keep building things and learning as you go.

My goal is pretty simple: keep building stuff that actually helps people.
