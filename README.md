## hey, i'm jade 

Hi, I'm Jade.

I'm an Informatics researcher and AI builder focused on accessible, ethical, practical technology that works for everyone...not just people who already understand it.

I've helped small businesses go online during the pandemic, developed AI tools for education, and redesigned websites for organizations like Middle Way House and Bloomington Chamber of Commerce. Across everything: does this solve a real problem for real people?

I work full stack...research, product design, development...and I'm currently expanding globally. Based in Madrid studying Strategic Management and Product Management at UCM, which has shaped how I approach building products with a broader perspective.

As a first-generation student, I think deeply about who technology gets built for...and who gets left out. That shapes everything.

Outside work, you'll find me café-hopping through Madrid's historic center, writing about ethical tech and AI's future, or attempting (with mixed success) to keep my jade plants alive

## iu life 

i'm an informatics student at indiana university (graduating spring 2027) and a hudson and holland scholar. i'm here because i care deeply about building technology that serves people...especially those who might feel left out by the tech world.

as a peer mentor at the office of student life, i love helping students find their footing and building confidence. as a handshake influencer, i work with iu luddy career services to create resources that make career planning feel less scary and more achievable.

the luddy study abroad scholarship and hutton international experiences program grant brought me to madrid this semester, where i'm soaking up new perspectives on how communities approach technology, challenging my own assumptions, and bringing it all back home.

• Developed affordable AI systems that helped businesses generate ideas and work faster while keeping that personal touch that makes small businesses special.

**user-centered design**
• Mapped friction points in student advising and built guides that give students a clear, independent path forward, consolidating scattered campus resources into one accessible tool designed for first-generation and low-income students.

## what i'm focused on rn 

this semester in madrid, i'm diving into product management and strategic thinking to bring a more global lens to how i build. i'm fascinated by spain's fintech innovations and how they could inspire ethical, scalable solutions for small businesses everywhere.

also slowly improving my spanish (muy lentamente, but we're getting there) and embracing bold, creative projects that scare me a little.

mostly though? learning, growing, and building things that actually matter.
