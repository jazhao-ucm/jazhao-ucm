### Key Points
- Globalization: Free movement of goods/services/capital; interconnected economies; China, India, Indonesia as major winners
- Slowbalization: Slowing globalization, rise of protectionism, more localization
- Glocalization: Adapting global products/services for local markets (“Think global, act local”)
- Economic Complexity: Transforming raw materials into complex products using tech, innovation, R&D; higher complexity = higher value
- G20: 20 countries, ~50% of global economic activity, most important for trade/industry
- Demographics: Africa’s population rising, Europe aging, Asia peaking then declining
- Value Chain: Raw materials → Tech/Innovation → Complex products
- Supply Chain: Suppliers → Procurement → Manufacturing → Distribution → Consumers; flows: Physical, Information, Financial
- Transport Modes: Road, Rail, Air, Sea (90% of world shipments by sea); container types: dry, refrigerated, special
- Project Risk: Highest during execution phase
- Hofstede’s Dimensions: Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, Indulgence
- Cultural Distance: Sum of differences across Hofstede’s six dimensions; greater distance = more management complexity
- Market Entry: Export/franchising (low risk), joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries (high control/risk)
- Country Risk: Economic/political stability, trade barriers, industry rivalry
- Cross-Cultural Skills: Language, empathy, respect, adaptability, communication
- Simulation Tips: Review all country data, balance attractiveness with risk, use cultural distance for adaptation, monitor news/crises, choose entry mode based on context

### Diagrams/Sketches
- Value Chain: Raw Materials → Transform → Manufacturing → Sell → Customers
- Supply Chain: Suppliers → Procurement → Manufacturing → Distribution → Consumers
- Hofstede’s Dimensions Table (draw as needed)

### Questions/To-Do
- What are the main differences between globalization and slowbalization?
- How does economic complexity impact a country’s competitiveness?
- Practice calculating cultural distance using Hofstede’s dimensions
- Review transport mode pros/cons for different products
- Prepare examples of market entry strategies for simulation
- What are the key risks in international business simulation scenarios?
- How do you adapt management style for high vs. low power distance cultures?
