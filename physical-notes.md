### Key Points

- **Globalization:** Free movement of goods, services, capital; interconnected economies; China, India, Indonesia as major winners.
- **Slowbalization:** Slowing globalization, rise of protectionism, more localization.
- **Glocalization:** Adapting global products/services for local markets; “Think global, act local.”
- **Economic Complexity:** Transforming raw materials into complex products using tech, innovation, R&D. High complexity = higher value.
- **Major Players:** China (exporter, production), India (population, production), USA (importer, tech), Indonesia (GDP).
- **G20:** 20 countries, ~50% of global economic activity, most important for trade/industry.
- **Demographics:** Africa’s population rising, Europe aging, Asia peaking then declining.
- **Value Chain:** Raw materials → Tech/Innovation → Complex products.
- **Supply Chain:** Suppliers, Procurement, Manufacturing, Distribution, Consumers; flows: Physical, Information, Financial.
- **Transport Modes:** Road, Rail, Air, Sea; container types: dry, refrigerated, special.
- **Project Risk:** Highest during execution phase.
- **Hofstede’s Dimensions:** Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, Indulgence.
- **Cultural Distance:** Sum of differences across Hofstede’s six dimensions.
- **Market Entry:** Export/franchising, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries.
- **Country Risk:** Economic/political stability, trade barriers, industry rivalry.
- **Cross-Cultural Skills:** Language, empathy, respect, adaptability, communication.

- How does economic complexity impact a country’s competitiveness?
- Practice calculating cultural distance using Hofstede’s dimensions.
- Review transport mode pros/cons for different products.
- Prepare examples of market entry strategies for simulation.
