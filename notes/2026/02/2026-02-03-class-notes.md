## 📚 Key Concepts

### 1. Power Distance (PDI) - Detailed Analysis

#### What is Power Distance?
The distance/gap between the boss and the employee. How hierarchical or equal a society is.

**Key Point:** It's not black and white - it's a scale from 0 to 100. Countries can be high, low, or somewhere in between.

#### High Power Distance Characteristics

**1. More powerful members perceive subordinates as unequal**
- Boss is the boss, you don't question them
- Big gap between CEO and janitor
- Example countries: **USA, Russia, Mexico, Spain, France**
- "Very high" in many countries

**2. Members accept power distance as part of social order**
- It determines what is right and wrong
- Hierarchy is accepted as natural
- Example: Spain, France - "very high"

**3. Not much trust among coworkers**
- People don't share information
- Information kept to themselves
- "Selfish" behavior
- Not helping the company overall
- Example: High power distance companies have low trust

**4. Subordinates are blamed for mistakes**
- When something goes wrong, blame goes to individuals
- "You did something wrong" = your fault
- Example: Mexico - young people blamed for mistakes

**5. Subordinates fear the more powerful members**
- Employees afraid of bosses
- Can't speak freely
- Example: Mexico - employees line up, afraid to make mistakes

**6. Acceptance of privileges that come with power**
- Bosses get privileges because they're bosses
- "You have conditions, which is fine, but because you have to get all the privileges"
- Example: France - high power distance, privileges accepted

**7. Strong chain of command**
- Clear hierarchy
- Orders flow from top to bottom
- Example: Spain - "strong chain of command"

#### Low Power Distance Characteristics

**1. Everyone should have equal rights**
- More equal relationships
- Less hierarchy
- Example: **Sweden, Iceland** - "really good"

**2. The system is blamed (not individuals)**
- When something goes wrong, look at the system
- "It's not your fault, it's our problem"
- Try to fix problems together
- Example: USA - "the system is blamed"

**3. Subordinates considered as older, more experienced colleagues**
- More collaborative approach
- Learning from each other
- Example: Low power distance cultures

**4. Co-workers prone to trust one another**
- More sharing of information
- Better teamwork
- Example: Low power distance companies

**Key Insight:** Power distance affects how mistakes are handled, how information is shared, and how people interact in the workplace.

### 2. Culture Shock - The 4 Phases

**The Graph:**

### 4. Cultural Intelligence & Acculturation

#### What is Acculturation?
The process of adapting to a new culture. Gaining cultural intelligence through experience and learning.

**The Process:**
1. **Education** (High school level)
   - Low level of knowledge about culture
   - Books, lectures
   - Basic understanding

2. **Training** (College level)
   - Case studies
   - Feeling and understanding
   - **Culture awareness**
   - You're a student living abroad
   - Gain cultural intelligence

3. **Integration** (Professional level)
   - Working from different places
   - Step by step
   - Full adaptation
   - Cultural intelligence achieved

**Key Point:** Cultural intelligence comes through education, training, and integration. It's a journey, not instant.

### 5. Cultural Distance & Business Success

#### What is Cultural Distance?
How different cultures are from each other. Measured across multiple dimensions:
- Economy
- Politics
- Society
- Geography
- Communication
- Language
- Legal system

#### Examples of Cultural Distance

**Small Distance (Easier):**
- **USA ↔ UK:** Not really different
- Same language (English)
- Similar culture, future, people, legal system
- Won't take too long to understand
- Easier to do business

**Medium Distance:**
- **USA ↔ Spain:** Some differences
- Different language
- Different culture
- Need to adapt
- Moderate challenge

**Large Distance (Harder):**

### 6. Real Business Example - Failure Due to Cultural Distance

**The Story:**

### 7. Communication - The 35/65 Rule

#### The Rule
- **35% = What you say** (actual words)
- **65% = How you say it** (body language, facial expressions, tone, gestures)

**Studies Show:**
- In communication, **65% to 93%** is influenced by non-verbal elements
- **93%** - that's a lot!
- "How you say it is more important than what you say"

#### What Counts as "How You Say It"?
- **Facial expressions**
- **Tone of voice**
- **Gestures**
- **Eye contact**
- **Posture**
- **Movement**
- **Body language**

#### Business Implications

**For Interviews/Business:**
- Don't just say "I'm motivated" - **SHOW it**
- Show enthusiasm
- Make eye contact
- Use positive body language
- Show energy and engagement

**For Negotiations:**
- How you act is very important
- Shows your motivation, preparation, and experience
- Sometimes what you're NOT saying is more important than what you ARE saying
- Non-verbal communication matters more than words

**Key Point:** "What we are not saying can be more important than what we are saying." This is crucial in business negotiations and interactions.

### 8. Cultural Empathy

#### What is Cultural Empathy?
Understanding and appreciating how other people's culture is different from yours - **NOT because it's weird, but because it makes sense in THEIR context**.

#### Why It Matters
- More tolerant of differences
- Better at business across cultures
- Happier life overall
- Better employee/manager

- People are more tolerant of differences in others

#### Key Insight

**Key Point:** "You need to understand this concept of intercultural empathy. It makes for more peaceful work, and people are more tolerant of differences in others."

- Easy communication

**Complex/Professional Environments:**
- More formal
- No laughing (sometimes)

### 12. Group Formation & Cultural Similarity

#### Basic Similarity Among People

### 13. Verbal vs. Non-Verbal Language

#### Two Types of Language
- **Verbal language:** What we say (words)
- **Non-verbal language:** What we don't say (body language, gestures, expressions)

#### Key Difference
- Sometimes what we're **NOT saying** is more important than what we **ARE saying**
- Non-verbal communication often carries more meaning
- Crucial for negotiations and business interactions

#### Business Application
- In negotiations, how you act shows your motivation, preparation, and experience

- Non-verbal cues can make or break business deals

**Key Point:** Understanding the difference between verbal and non-verbal language is essential for successful international business communication.
