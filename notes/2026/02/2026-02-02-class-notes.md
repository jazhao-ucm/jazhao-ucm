## 📚 Key Concepts

### 1. Product Quality & Country Reputation

#### Japan - Quality Leader
- **Japan exports quality**
- When you buy from Japan, you buy quality
- High quality = expensive products
- Example: Japan exported planes (high quality, expensive)

#### China - Volume & Repetition
- **China = repetition for T (technology/products)**
- High volume production
- Lower cost, but quality varies
- "You have to build it" - manufacturing focus

**Key Point:** Quality products are expensive. Products from different countries have different reputations and price points.

### 2. Global Supply Chain - Everything is International

**Example: What You're Wearing**
- **Clothing:** From Vietnam (shoes), India (shirt - 70% made in India, not 100% USA)
- **Jewelry:** From Botswana (gold and silver)
  - Silver prices went up 200% in one year
  - Gold and silver are valuable resources
- **Other items:** From China, various countries

**Key Point:** Everything you wear comes from different countries. Nothing is 100% from one country anymore. This is the reality of globalization.

### 3. International Business Activities

**Definition:** Mixed home and host country activities

**Types:**
- **Home country activities:** Operations in your home country
- **Host country activities:** Operations in foreign countries

### 7. Competition Strategy - Go Where Competitors Are

#### The Scenario
- **Market A:** Your current market
- **Market B:** Many competitors already doing the same thing
- **Market C:** Very few people doing what you're doing

**Question:** Where do you go - B or C?

**Answer: Go to Market B (where competitors are)**

#### Why Go Where Competitors Are?

1. **Market Validation:**
   - If competitors are there, there's a market
   - Market B = proven demand
   - Market C = unproven, risky

2. **Learning Opportunity:**
   - You can learn from competitors
   - They have experience, money, technology, direct investment
   - You work with competitors and learn something

3. **Competition Makes You Better:**
   - Competition forces innovation
   - You improve your product/service
   - You differentiate yourself

4. **Real Example:**
   - Professor's ex-boss in France went to Mexico
   - They avoided competition
   - Result: "We lost everything because we had no market"
   - Lesson: "What makes you different?" - you need to differentiate

**Key Point:** Don't escape competition - go where competitors are. Competition validates the market and helps you improve. You need to differentiate yourself, not avoid competition.

**Warning:** It's very tricky. Even professionals can be wrong thinking to escape competition. It's a huge mistake.

### 8. Porter's Five Forces Model

**Tool for Competition Analysis:**
- Used at university level
- Framework for analyzing competition
- Helps understand competitive environment

**Key Point:** Use analytical tools like Porter's Five Forces to understand competition, not avoid it.

---

### 9. Culture Definition

**Definition:** "Culture can be defined as the set of shared beliefs, values, and other norms that distinguish one group of people from another."

**Key Elements:**
- **Shared beliefs:** What people believe
- **Values:** What people value
- **Norms:** How people behave
- **Distinguishes groups:** What makes groups different

**Examples:**
- Different religions
- Different beliefs
- Different values
- Different ways of thinking
- Different behaviors

**Key Point:** Culture is massive and important in business. When people from different countries, regions, and cultures work together, cultural differences matter. You can't make them think like you - you need to understand and adapt.

**Personal Example:** Professor (French) went to Chile, didn't speak Spanish. Very tough to adapt, learn how to live, work, and speak. "Business is just a nightmare" without cultural adaptation.

### 10. Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions

**About Geert Hofstede:**
- Dutch interculturalist
- Worked with IBM (1967-1973)
- Traveled with American company
- Found differences between countries
- Developed framework with **5 dimensions** (originally, now 6)

#### Dimension 1: Power Distance

**Definition:** The distance in hierarchy between someone who's higher up (like a manager) and employees. The difference in power.

**High Power Distance:**
- Strong management hierarchy
- Big differences between managers and employees
- Depends on the country
- Many countries have high power distance

**Low Power Distance:**
- More equal relationships
- Less hierarchy
- Example: Some countries have low power distance

**Key Point:** Power distance affects how business is conducted, how management works, and how employees interact with managers.

#### Dimension 2: Individualism vs. Collectivism

**Individualism:**
- "I" consciousness
- Individual achievement valued
- Self-reliance important
- Examples: USA, Western countries

**Collectivism:**
- "We" consciousness
- Group harmony valued
- Interdependence important
- Examples: Many Asian, Latin American countries

**Key Point:** Some countries are more individualistic, others more collectivistic. This affects how people work together and make decisions.

#### Dimension 3: Gender (Masculinity vs. Femininity)

**About Gender Differences:**
- Not about biological differences
- About cultural roles and expectations
- Some countries have huge gender gaps
- Some countries have minimal differences

**Example - Spain:**
- International Women's Day
- Professor asked to speak about women in business
- Answer: "When it comes to woman and man, where I'm from, there is no big difference. It is nothing between men and women - the same people."

**Countries with Zero Gender Gap:**
- **Norway, Sweden:** Zero difference between men and women
- Still some differences remain (we don't know why)
- These countries are doing better

**Key Point:** Gender dimension measures cultural expectations and roles, not biological differences. Some countries have achieved near-zero gender gaps.

#### Dimension 4: Uncertainty Avoidance

**Definition:** How comfortable people are with uncertainty and change.

**High Uncertainty Avoidance:**
- Prefer rules and structure
- Avoid uncertainty
- Want clear guidelines

**Low Uncertainty Avoidance:**
- Comfortable with ambiguity
- More flexible
- Less need for rules

**Key Point:** Different countries handle uncertainty differently. This affects business practices and risk-taking.

#### Dimension 5: Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation

**Long-Term Orientation (Right side, close to 100):**
- Think about future
- Health, security, investment, growth
- Plan ahead
- Examples: Many Asian countries

**Short-Term Orientation (Left side, close to 0):**
- Focus on present
- Immediate needs
- Less future planning

**USA Example - Long-Term Orientation:**
- People think: Get a job → Get married → Get mortgage → Retirement
- "This is what you have in your head"
- You sit here because you're going to get a job
- You're not thinking short-term
- You think long-term because you can, because you know something will happen

**Key Point:** Long-term orientation means thinking about the future - job, marriage, retirement. Short-term orientation means focusing on immediate needs. It depends on your life situation and whether you can plan for the future.

### 11. Culture Shock - Phases of Adaptation

**Definition:** The initial phase when you move to a new country - you get very strongly attached to something, then go through different phases.

**Phase 1: Excitement (Honeymoon Phase)**
- Remember the day you left your home country
- Excitement about new place
- "You don't know what's something, but something" - anticipation
- Everything seems new and exciting

**Phases (to be continued):**
- Professor will cover exact stages and locations tomorrow
- Will provide detailed explanation of culture shock phases
- Important for understanding adaptation process

**Key Point:** When you move to a new country, you go through phases. The first is excitement/honeymoon phase. More phases to be discussed.

### 12. What You Cannot Escape

**Things You Can Improve/Change:**
- Taxes (can be managed)
- Logistics (can be improved)
- Finance (can be improved)
- Situation (can be improved)

**Things You CANNOT Escape:**
- **Communication and language**
- **Culture**

**Key Point:** If you choose not to adapt yourself, you cannot escape culture and communication. These are fundamental challenges in international business that must be faced, not avoided.

**Future Focus:** Culture is the future. You cannot escape it - you must adapt.

---

### 13. Containerization & Global Logistics

#### The Big Picture
- **China:** Biggest exporter (huge vessel)
- Ships pull from different continents
- Different colors and sizes of containers

#### Why Different Container Sizes?
- **Different transportation needs:**
  - Dry containers (nothing special inside)
  - Controlled humidity containers
  - Special containers for different goods
- **Different goods require different handling:**
  - Not all goods can be mixed
  - Need specialized containers
  - Temperature control, humidity control, etc.

**Key Point:** Containerization is crucial for global transportation. Different goods need different types of containers. This is essential for international logistics.

### 14. Global Manufacturing - Boeing vs. Airbus

#### Boeing Example
- **Location:** Chicago (assembly)
- **Parts from:** Multiple different parts of the world
- **Process:** Parts from different countries → Assembled in one place
- **Why?** Not 100% from one place because of:
  - Transportation differences
  - Quality differences
  - Expensive vs. cheaper parts
  - Different competencies

#### Boeing vs. Airbus
- **Two big brands:** Boeing and Airbus
- **Competition:** Both competing globally
- **Different approaches:** Different strategies, prices, quality
- **People:** Both have people from different backgrounds, countries, competencies
- **Best in the world:** Both are among the best aircraft manufacturers

**Key Point:** Global manufacturing means parts from different countries, assembled in one place. Different companies have different strategies, but both need global supply chains and diverse teams.
