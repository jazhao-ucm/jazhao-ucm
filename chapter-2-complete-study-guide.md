## 📌 INTRODUCTION TO CROSS-CULTURAL COMPETENCE

### What is Culture?
**Definition:** "The set of shared beliefs, values, and other norms that distinguish one group of people from another."

### Why Culture Matters in Business
- Working with people from different cultures is **more complicated** than working with people from the same culture
- **Language is only one aspect** - cultural norms, values, and behaviors are equally important
- Understanding culture makes international business **easier and more successful**
- Cultural competence is essential for managing international operations

### The Reality of International Business
- Companies operate across **national and international boundaries**
- **Cannot avoid** dealing with different cultures when doing business globally
- Cultural differences affect:
  - Communication styles
  - Decision-making processes
  - Management approaches
  - Business relationships
  - Trust and cooperation

## 🌍 GEERT HOFSTEDE'S CULTURAL DIMENSIONS FRAMEWORK

### About Geert Hofstede
- **Dutch interculturalist** and one of the most noted academics exploring culture
- **IBM psychologist (1967-1973)**
- Collected and analyzed data from **over 100,000 individuals** from **over 50 countries**
- Developed a model identifying cultural dimensions to differentiate cultures
- Framework widely used in international business

### The Six Cultural Dimensions

#### 1. Power Distance Index (PDI)
**Definition:** The extent to which members who are less powerful in a society accept and expect that power is distributed unequally.

**HIGH Power Distance Cultures:**
- Members accept power distance as part of social order
- Determines what is right and wrong
- More powerful members perceive subordinates as **unequal**
- **Subordinates fear** the more powerful members
- Not much trust among co-workers
- Majority of people are dependent on others
- **Subordinates are blamed** for mistakes
- Social inequalities are accepted
- Every person has a high or low place in social order (protected by law)
- Acceptance of privileges that come with power

**Examples of High PDI Countries:** Malaysia, Philippines, Mexico, India, China

**LOW Power Distance Cultures:**
- Power is exerted **only where necessary**
- People are equal; social inequalities considered obsolete
- Cooperation based on principle of **solidarity**
- **Subordinates considered as older, more experienced colleagues**
- Co-workers prone to trust one another
- **The system is blamed** for mistakes (not individuals)
- Everyone should have equal rights
- Strong and weak members coexist in harmony

**Examples of Low PDI Countries:** Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden

**Business Implications:**
- **High PDI:** Hierarchical structures, top-down decision making, formal communication
- **Low PDI:** Flat organizations, participative decision making, informal communication
- **Critical for managers:** Adapt leadership style to cultural context

---

#### 6. Indulgence vs. Restraint
**Definition:** The extent to which a society values the satisfaction of human needs and desires.

**INDULGENCE (High Score):**

## 📊 CULTURAL DISTANCE CALCULATION

### What is Cultural Distance?
**In the simulation:** Cultural Distance between two countries is calculated based on the **sum of the differences in scores on each of the six dimensions of culture.**

### Formula Concept:
```
Cultural Distance = 
|Country A PDI - Country B PDI| +
|Country A Individualism - Country B Individualism| +
|Country A Masculinity - Country B Masculinity| +
|Country A UAI - Country B UAI| +
|Country A LTO - Country B LTO| +
|Country A Indulgence - Country B Indulgence|
```

### Why Cultural Distance Matters:
- **Greater cultural distance = Greater challenges** in international operations
- Affects:
  - Communication difficulties
  - Management complexity
  - Employee training needs
  - Adaptation requirements
  - **Entry mode selection** (greater distance → more careful entry)

### Business Strategy Implications:
- **Low cultural distance:** Easier to transfer business practices, lower adaptation costs
- **High cultural distance:** Need more localization, higher training investment, consider local partners
