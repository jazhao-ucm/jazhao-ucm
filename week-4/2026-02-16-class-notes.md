## Key Concepts

### I. Technology Adoption Curve (S-Curve)

Key Concept: Technology performance follows an S-curve pattern over time

A. The Pattern
1. Beginning: Slow performance improvement, technology evolving
2. Middle: Rapid performance improvement (steep part of the curve)
3. Maturity: Performance plateaus, incremental improvements
4. Decline: Old technology replaced by new technology

B. Visual Representation
1. "So basically, this, you see, , you see that."
2. "And after the words, we are disint points. Again?"
3. Performance starts low, increases rapidly, then levels off

Key Insight: "So this is how we are the psycho of ."

C. Investment Pattern
1. Early stage: Low investment, uncertain returns
2. Growth stage: Heavy investment as performance improves
3. Maturity: Investment shifts to new technologies
4. "So the parents think that we are waiting for in. Is start to bed investing into a meeting."

### II. Performance vs. Time - Technology Lifecycle

A. The Curve
1. Beginning: Low performance, high uncertainty
2. Growth: Rapid performance improvement
3. Maturity: Performance plateaus
4. Replacement: New technology emerges

Key Point: "So we stay here, it's going back. We can see? This is the .."

B. Example - Old Technology Performance
1. Old technology performance declines as new technology emerges
2. "And then, the performance of the old , this is how"
3. "So for instance, we go back . Jesus example of our own. , the beginning is less, much for system."

### III. Digital Cameras vs. Film Cameras - Kodak Case Study

A. The Transition
1. Film cameras → Digital cameras
2. "So basically wasn't also. , , like it."

B. Why Digital Won
1. Speed: "I feel like it's quicker to, like, develop it because, like, with film, you have to, like, send it and then send it back"
