## Key Concepts

### 1. Technology Adoption Curve (S-Curve)

**Key Concept:** Technology performance follows an S-curve pattern over time

**The Pattern:**
- **Beginning:** Slow performance improvement, technology evolving
- **Middle:** Rapid performance improvement (steep part of the curve)
- **Maturity:** Performance plateaus, incremental improvements
- **Decline:** Old technology replaced by new technology

**Visual Representation:**
- "So basically, this, you see, , you see that."
- "And after the words, we are disint points. Again?"
- Performance starts low, increases rapidly, then levels off

**Key Insight:** "So this is how we are the psycho of ."

**Investment Pattern:**
- Early stage: Low investment, uncertain returns
- Growth stage: Heavy investment as performance improves
- Maturity: Investment shifts to new technologies
- "So the parents think that we are waiting for in. Is start to bed investing into a meeting."

### 2. Performance vs. Time - Technology Lifecycle

**The Curve:**
- **Beginning:** Low performance, high uncertainty
- **Growth:** Rapid performance improvement
- **Maturity:** Performance plateaus
- **Replacement:** New technology emerges

**Key Point:** "So we stay here, it's going back. We can see? This is the .."

**Example - Old Technology Performance:**
- Old technology performance declines as new technology emerges
- "And then, the performance of the old , this is how"
- "So for instance, we go back . Jesus example of our own. , the beginning is less, much for system."

### 3. Digital Cameras vs. Film Cameras - Kodak Case Study

**The Transition:**
- Film cameras → Digital cameras
- "So basically wasn't also. , , like it."

**Why Digital Won:**
- **Speed:** "I feel like it's quicker to, like, develop it because, like, with film, you have to, like, send it and then send it back"
- **Storage:** "What happens, he says here scorage storage and basically can make all the"
- **Convenience:** No need for film processing
- **Cost:** Don't have to keep buying film

**Kodak's Situation:**
- "They were nothing to see that myself. They were his intependence."
- "They were his intependence. I basically it has to be."
- "They are basic horses."

**The Problem:**
- Kodak was the largest player in film photography
- "Go he was used to be the largest player . Montar."
- They didn't adapt to digital technology
- "So what happened? So . You are."

**Competitors:**
- Canon, Sony, Nikon succeeded in digital
- "So what do you say the method and the VG, which one? Anyone? Cannon? . Sony? Sony?"
- Kodak lost market leadership

**Why Kodak Failed:**
- "So they lost. I, the action on the gold that bies."
- They were invested in old technology
- "Before once to more storage."
- "So, this man fish radio, and then he one of three times more. Four times the average number."
- They couldn't adapt quickly enough

**Key Insight:** "So basically if you try that West like six levels. So in the end, you have to be some."

**The Dilemma:**
- "So in the end, you have to be some. And what you see , the DC.."
- "Is it because all the three companies that we named before did it better than they did?"
- Kodak had 30 years of dominance but couldn't transition

---

### 4. The Innovator's Dilemma

**Key Question:** "Imagine you are , and the name we shut down this old film technology that is in remaining all theode of the fact, and why we invest into this unsor . What do you think will be in?"

**The Challenge:**
- Old technology is still profitable
- New technology is unproven
- "A seal would be with, I'm stay with you."
- "Yeah, so they' police on to stay with you, if you don't ."
- "You are money, then maybe you think that why are you front of trying to money. If you already get killed , aren't well. ?"

**The Problem:**
- Companies stick with profitable old technology
- Don't invest in disruptive new technology
- "That's fine. Evening, is a this here is the technologies are developed by ."
- "He is not he."

**Key Insight:** "So that's the thing. , not always start."

### 5. Smartphones - iPhone Case Study

**Before iPhone:**
- "Before Apple, we from Wesley United in the bill, in ."

- "You guys give the size for the first moment."

**Touchscreen:**
- "What's better when? The. The. They both."
- Touchscreen interface was revolutionary
- "So these first team and then eating money all the oil team."

**Apple's Approach:**
- "You' basically all fans. We invest in the more and more than more is more dead."
- Heavy investment in new technology
- "So the first, so when he met his mouths right."

**Initial Reception:**
- "So they were around. So the answer from the worldal directors ofia and the show them this new."
- "No otherwise. This is all that. This is no, is difference nonsense."
- Skeptical initial response

**The First iPhone:**
- "So they the all about that is, they take care of"
- "And I And then the first iPhone, anyone ."
- Revolutionary design and interface

**Key Difference:**
- "So see West in the States. We can be, and the West W back that no men were anywhere."
- "It was not where super messy, I mean, was super easy. Masses like that.."
- Much easier to use than previous smartphones

### 6. Disruptive Innovation - The Pattern

**What Happens:**
- New technology starts with lower performance
- "So what do you think these sc change? Now you."
- "Why did you stay in get my inside so mad and thisol ? , everything."
- "It is, every, everything most firm."

**The Transition:**
- "So white, 74 words was different, was creat ."
- New technology improves rapidly
- "Yeah, so the thing is thatly in this game in this, ."
- "If you get score here in theuts, then ."

**Performance Comparison:**
- Old technology: High performance initially
- New technology: Lower performance initially, but improves
- "And the same you can see here, these guys swelled saying a pointing46 point as a word belie ."
- "And these highids because air points and the guy . You in."

**Key Insight:** "So that's five days for all these."

- "So we can pay this very very easy."
- Technology keeps improving incrementally

**Failed Alternatives:**
- "Bad data being hundred of different companies trying to enter in Or New for breaking chets or mines now based on this pre."
- "D completely different paper."
- "And all the so part of the ."
- Many attempts to replace it, all failed

**Key Point:**
- "That's why I still we keep what we."
- "This is why we are our computers are based on nothing 90, 60 years old."
- Because no one has been successful [at replacing it].

**Quantum Computing:**
- "So, now there's some discussion because there's something new called concuring."
- "Do you know computers? No. It's like the big computers."
- "So basically mic computers are trans technology."
- Still experimental, not yet replacing silicon
