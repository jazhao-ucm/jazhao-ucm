## Key Concepts

### I. Business Model Canvas - Overview

Purpose: Framework to describe and analyze a business model

Structure: Nine building blocks that describe how a company creates, delivers, and captures value

A. Key Insight
1. The canvas helps break down a business into its essential components and understand the connections between different parts.

B. **Note:** While there are nine steps/blocks, they can be grouped into three main questions
1. Who are we selling to? (Customer segments)
2. Why does it matter / What are we selling to them? (Value proposition)
3. How can we get them to buy more? (Channels, customer relationships, revenue streams)

## Business Model Canvas Applied: Zara - Skinny Jeans

### II. Customer Segments

Focus: People who buy skinny jeans from Zara

A. Demographics
1. Age: 17–27 years old (younger adults and older teens)
2. Location: Big cities (e.g. New York, LA, Miami) - urban shopping areas
3. Behavior: Trend-focused shoppers who want to look current/fashionable

B. Key Characteristics
1. Want jeans without paying premium prices
2. Want new jeans and feel they should buy now (scarcity/trend-driven)
3. Concerned that items might not be available next week or might not be in trend next week

Segmentation Note: Important to be specific—if you say "everyone," the customer segment becomes too broad and loses meaning. Focus on one specific product (e.g. skinny jeans) and the people who buy that product.
