## Key Concepts

### 1. Business Model Canvas - Overview

**Purpose:** Framework to describe and analyze a business model

**Structure:** Nine building blocks that describe how a company creates, delivers, and captures value

**Key Insight:** The canvas helps break down a business into its essential components and understand the connections between different parts.

**Note:** While there are nine steps/blocks, they can be grouped into three main questions:
1. **Who are we selling to?** (Customer segments)
2. **Why does it matter / What are we selling to them?** (Value proposition)
3. **How can we get them to buy more?** (Channels, customer relationships, revenue streams)

## Business Model Canvas Applied: Zara - Skinny Jeans

### 2. Customer Segments

**Focus:** People who buy skinny jeans from Zara

**Demographics:**
- **Age:** 17–27 years old (younger adults and older teens)
- **Location:** Big cities (e.g. New York, LA, Miami) - urban shopping areas
- **Behavior:** Trend-focused shoppers who want to look current/fashionable

**Key Characteristics:**
- Want jeans without paying premium prices
- Want new jeans and feel they should buy now (scarcity/trend-driven)
- Concerned that items might not be available next week or might not be in trend next week

**Segmentation Note:** Important to be specific—if you say "everyone," the customer segment becomes too broad and loses meaning. Focus on one specific product (e.g. skinny jeans) and the people who buy that product.

### 3. Value Proposition

**What Zara offers for skinny jeans:**

1. **On-trend / Current styling**
   - Jeans feel current and fashionable
   - "You have to buy it now" mentality
   - If you don't buy now, it might not be trendy later

2. **Good quality**
   - Compared to competitors (Old Navy, Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Levi's)
   - Comfortable and durable
   - Good sizing and fit

3. **Convenience**
   - Available online
   - Easy to find and purchase
   - Can complete outfits with other Zara items

4. **Mid-price positioning**
   - Not premium pricing (like designer brands)
   - Not the cheapest option
   - Positioned between low-end and high-end competitors
   - Average price around $30 for skinny jeans

5. **Scarcity / Limited quantities**
   - Fast fashion model: items available for limited time
   - Creates urgency ("buy now or miss out")

**Why customers care:**
- People who want jeans without paying premium prices
- Want to look trendy and current
- Value convenience and good fit

### 4. Channels

**Distribution channels:**

1. **Physical stores**
   - Located in big cities (New York, LA, Miami)
   - Urban shopping areas
   - Visual merchandising and store layout important

2. **Online / Website**
   - E-commerce platform
   - Can browse and purchase online

**Key Point:** Zara uses both physical and digital channels to reach customers.

### 5. Customer Relationships

**How Zara maintains relationships with customers:**

1. **Self-service**
   - Customers browse and shop independently
   - Both in-store and online

2. **Repeat visits**
   - Fast fashion model encourages frequent shopping
   - New items arrive twice a week
   - Limited quantities create urgency for return visits

3. **Online relationships**
   - Website and digital presence
   - Email marketing, social media

**Key Strategy:** High turnover of products (items only available for ~2 weeks) encourages customers to return frequently to see new items.

### 6. Revenue Streams

**How Zara makes money from skinny jeans:**

1. **Full-price sales**
   - Sell jeans at full price (not discounted)
   - Avoid mass production and constant discounting (unlike competitors like Gap, Old Navy)

2. **Price positioning**
   - Price carefully compared to competitors (Gap, AE, Levi's)
   - Not too high (would lose price-sensitive customers)
   - Not too low (would reduce margins)
   - Mid-price positioning ($30 average for skinny jeans)

3. **Inventory management**
   - Only restock items that are selling well
   - Cut items that aren't performing
   - Minimize overproduction and markdowns

**Key Insight:** Zara avoids the discount cycle that many competitors use—instead of producing large quantities and then discounting, they produce smaller batches and sell at full price.
