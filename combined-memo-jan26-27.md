# Global Management: Key Concepts & Cross-Cultural Competence

**Quick Reference Memo – Jan 26 & 27, 2026**

---

## How to Use This Memo
- Use as a fast review for exams, assignments, or simulation prep
- Each section is a summary of the most actionable and tested concepts

---

## 1. Globalization, Glocalization, Slowbalization
**Globalization:** Free movement of goods, services, capital; high production/export; interconnected economies (China, India, Indonesia = winners)

**Slowbalization:** Slowing globalization, more protectionism, reduced trade, focus on localization

**Glocalization:** Adapting global products/services for local markets (“Think global, act local”)

---

## 2. Economic Complexity & Major Players
**Economic Complexity:** Transforming raw materials into complex products via tech, innovation, R&D (higher complexity = higher value)

**Top Countries:** USA, UK, Netherlands, Britain (innovation/tech leaders); Africa lags

**China & India:** Massive populations, high production/export; China = world’s biggest exporter

**USA:** World’s largest importer, strong in software/tech

**Indonesia:** Top 3 in GDP

---

## 3. Geopolitical & Economic Shifts
- Production/business shifting from Europe/USA to Asia
- Middle East (esp. Saudi Arabia) rising in importance
- Venezuela: 2x Saudi oil reserves but economic issues
- Saudi Arabia: Led by MBS, regionally dominant

---

## 4. Trade, Tariffs & Protectionism
- US uses tariffs to protect domestic companies/jobs (esp. vs. China, Indonesia)
- “If we can’t stop China, we slow them down”
- France vs. Brazil: French food exports struggle vs. cheaper Brazilian products

---

## 5. G20 & Demographics
**G20:** 20 countries, ~50% of global economic activity, most important for trade/industry (Spain is a member)

**Demographics:**
- Asia: largest population, will peak then decline
- Africa: rapid growth (esp. Nigeria), will become dominant
- Europe: aging population; by ~2032, 400M people, 60% over 60
- Labor force size affects production/pricing

---

## 6. Value Chain, Supply Chain & Logistics
- **Value Chain:** Raw materials → Tech/Innovation → Complex products
- **Supply Chain:** Suppliers, Procurement, Manufacturing, Distribution, Consumers; flows: Physical, Information, Financial
- **Transport Modes:** Road, Rail, Air, Sea (90% of world shipments by sea); container types: dry, refrigerated, special
- **Project Risk:** Highest during execution phase

---

## 7. Cross-Cultural Competence (Jan 27th Focus)

- **Culture:** Shared beliefs, values, and norms distinguishing groups.
- **Why it matters:** International business requires managing across cultures; language is only one aspect—norms, values, behaviors are equally important.
- **Hofstede’s Six Dimensions:**
  1. Power Distance (hierarchy vs. equality)
  2. Individualism vs. Collectivism (I vs. We)
  3. Masculinity vs. Femininity (achievement vs. quality of life)
  4. Uncertainty Avoidance (rules vs. flexibility)
  5. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (future vs. present)
  6. Indulgence vs. Restraint (gratification vs. duty)
- **Cultural Distance:** Sum of differences across all six dimensions; greater distance = greater management complexity.
- **Business Implications:**
  - Leadership style, decision-making, communication, hiring, motivation, teamwork, risk-taking, planning, consumer behavior.

---

## 8. International Business Simulation & Market Entry

- **Country Selection:** GDP, population, market characteristics, cultural factors, risk.
- **Entry Modes:** Export/franchising (low risk), joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries (high control/risk).
- **Local Marketing:** Adapt to local preferences while maintaining brand identity.
- **Market Attractiveness:** GDP per capita, growth, population, indulgence score.
- **Country Risk:** Economic/political stability, trade barriers, industry rivalry.

---

## 9. Managing People Across Cultures

- **Complexity:** Different expectations about authority, respect, communication, work ethics.
- **Essential Skills:** Language, empathy, respect, cross-cultural communication, adaptability.
- **Age/Experience:** Younger managers may face credibility challenges in high PDI cultures.

---

## 10. Key Takeaways & Exam Tips

- Globalization is slowing (“slowbalization”); economic complexity is key to high-value exports.
- Demographic shifts will reshape the global economy (Africa rising, Europe aging).
- China/India dominate production and export markets; USA is the world’s largest importer.
- Protectionism is rising; future belongs to countries with young populations and resources.
- Understand Hofstede’s dimensions, value chain, supply chain, and market entry strategies.
- Practice cultural distance calculations and case analysis for simulation/exam.

---

## 11. Lecture Anecdotes & Real-World Examples

- Aircraft assembly: Parts sourced globally, assembled in different countries (e.g., Chicago, Paris, Mexico).
- Container types: Dry, refrigerated, special—used for different goods and logistics needs.
- Classroom stories: Diversity in backgrounds, importance of empathy and respect, real challenges in cross-cultural management.
