# Global Management: Key Concepts, Trends & Cross-Cultural Competence

**Combined Memo: January 26 & 27, 2026**

---

## 1. Globalization, Slowbalization & Glocalization

- **Globalization:** Free movement of goods, services, and capital; high production and exportation; interconnected economies. Major winners: China, India, Indonesia.
- **Slowbalization:** Slowing of globalization; rise of protectionism; reduced exports/imports; focus on localization. Driven by trade tensions, tariffs, and national security.
- **Glocalization:** Adapting global products/services for local markets; necessary before internationalization; "Think global, act local."

---

## 2. Economic Complexity & Major Global Players

- **Economic Complexity:** Ability to transform raw materials into complex products using technology, innovation, and R&D. Complex products = higher value.
- **Top Countries:** USA, UK, Netherlands, Britain (strong innovation/tech sectors). Africa lags behind.
- **China & India:** Massive populations, high production, and exports. China: world’s biggest exporter; cheap labor; single-party system.
- **USA:** World’s largest importer; strong in software and technology.
- **Indonesia:** Top 3 in GDP.

---

## 3. Geopolitical & Economic Shifts

- Production/business shifting from Europe/USA to Asia.
- Middle East (esp. Saudi Arabia) is increasingly important.
- Venezuela: 2x Saudi oil reserves but faces economic issues.
- Saudi Arabia: Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), dominant in the region.

---

## 4. Trade, Tariffs & Protectionism

- US uses tariffs to protect domestic companies and jobs, especially against China and Indonesia.
- Strategy: “If we can’t stop China, we slow them down.”
- France vs. Brazil: French food exports struggle to compete with cheaper Brazilian products.

## 5. The G20 & Demographics

- **G20:** 20 countries with highest GDP, most important for exports/imports, best industrialization; ~50% of global economic activity. Spain is a member.
- **Demographics:**
  - Asia: largest population, will peak then decline.
  - Africa: rapid growth, especially Nigeria; will become dominant demographic region.
  - Europe: aging population; by ~2032, 400M people, 60% over age 60.
- Labor force size affects production and pricing.

---

## 6. Value Chain, Supply Chain & Logistics

- **Value Chain:** Raw materials → Technology/Innovation/R&D → Complex products (e.g., computers, iPhones).
- **Supply Chain:** 5 components (Suppliers, Procurement, Manufacturing, Distribution, Consumers) + 3 flows (Physical, Information, Financial).
- **Transport Modes:** Road, Rail, Air, Sea (90% of world shipments by sea). Container types: dry, refrigerated, special.
- **Project Risk:** Highest during execution phase.

## 7. Cross-Cultural Competence (Jan 27th Focus)

- **Culture:** Shared beliefs, values, and norms distinguishing groups.
- **Why it matters:** International business requires managing across cultures; language is only one aspect—norms, values, behaviors are equally important.
- **Hofstede’s Six Dimensions:**
  1. Power Distance (hierarchy vs. equality)
  2. Individualism vs. Collectivism (I vs. We)
  3. Masculinity vs. Femininity (achievement vs. quality of life)
  4. Uncertainty Avoidance (rules vs. flexibility)
  5. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (future vs. present)
  6. Indulgence vs. Restraint (gratification vs. duty)
- **Cultural Distance:** Sum of differences across all six dimensions; greater distance = greater management complexity.
- **Business Implications:**
  - Leadership style, decision-making, communication, hiring, motivation, teamwork, risk-taking, planning, consumer behavior.

## 8. International Business Simulation & Market Entry

- **Country Selection:** GDP, population, market characteristics, cultural factors, risk.
- **Entry Modes:** Export/franchising (low risk), joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries (high control/risk).
- **Local Marketing:** Adapt to local preferences while maintaining brand identity.
- **Market Attractiveness:** GDP per capita, growth, population, indulgence score.
- **Country Risk:** Economic/political stability, trade barriers, industry rivalry.

---

## 9. Managing People Across Cultures

- **Complexity:** Different expectations about authority, respect, communication, work ethics.
- **Essential Skills:** Language, empathy, respect, cross-cultural communication, adaptability.
- **Age/Experience:** Younger managers may face credibility challenges in high PDI cultures.

---

## 10. Key Takeaways & Exam Tips

- Globalization is slowing (“slowbalization”); economic complexity is key to high-value exports.
- Demographic shifts will reshape the global economy (Africa rising, Europe aging).
- China/India dominate production and export markets; USA is the world’s largest importer.
- Protectionism is rising; future belongs to countries with young populations and resources.
- Understand Hofstede’s dimensions, value chain, supply chain, and market entry strategies.
- Practice cultural distance calculations and case analysis for simulation/exam.

## 11. Lecture Anecdotes & Real-World Examples

- Aircraft assembly: Parts sourced globally, assembled in different countries (e.g., Chicago, Paris, Mexico).
- Container types: Dry, refrigerated, special—used for different goods and logistics needs.
- Classroom stories: Diversity in backgrounds, importance of empathy and respect, real challenges in cross-cultural management.
