# Market Entry Simulation (HBP# FO0014) – Quick Study Notes

## What You Do
- Manage international strategy/operations for a casual dining chain (6 years)
- Decide: which countries to enter/grow/exit, entry modes, local marketing

---

## Key Concepts & Frameworks

**Globalization:** Free movement of goods/services/capital; interconnected economies

**Glocalization:** Adapting global products/services for local markets

**Slowbalization:** Slowing globalization, more protectionism/localization

**Market Attractiveness:**
- GDP per capita (income level)
- GDP growth (market potential)
- Population growth (customer base)

**Market Characteristics:**
- Country risk (instability)
- Trade barriers (tariffs)
- Industry rivalry (competition)

**Culture & Cultural Distance:**
- Hofstede’s 6 dimensions: Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, Indulgence
- Cultural distance = sum of differences in Hofstede scores
- High indulgence = more attractive for restaurants

**News & Crises:**
- News and crises can change country attractiveness and strategy
- Always factor in risk and be ready to adapt

---

## Simulation Success Tips
- Review all country data before making decisions
- Balance market attractiveness with risk
- Use cultural distance to guide adaptation and entry mode
- Monitor news, adapt to crises quickly
- Choose entry mode (franchise, JV, wholly owned) based on risk, control, and local context
