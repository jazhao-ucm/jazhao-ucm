**Write this on physical paper for better retention!**

## CHAPTER 1: GLOBALIZATION, GLOCALIZATION, SLOWBALIZATION

### Key Definitions
- **Globalization**: Free movement of goods, services, capital across borders. High production + high exportation. Winners: China, India, Indonesia
- **Slowbalization**: Slowing down of globalization. Countries becoming more protectionist. Reduced exports/imports. Focus on localization.
- **Glocalization**: Mixing global and local. "Think global, act local." Adapting products/services for local markets. Necessary before internationalization.

### Economic Complexity
- **Definition**: Ability to transform raw materials into complex products using technology, innovation, R&D
- **Top Countries**: USA, Britain, Netherlands, UK (all have strong innovation/technology)
- **Key Point**: Innovation in technology = difference between economic complexity and global distribution
- **Africa**: Currently lagging behind

### Major Global Players
- **China**: Biggest exporter globally. Massive population, cheap labor ($2/day), single party system, ahead of US in some sectors
- **India**: Second largest population, high production, top 2 in population/production/exploitation
- **USA**: Biggest importer globally. Strong in software/technology. Strategy: "If we can't stop China, we slow them down" (tariffs)
- **Indonesia**: Top 3 in GDP, high production capacity

### Demographics (Next 50-60 Years)
- **Asia**: Will peak then decline. Currently billions of people.
- **Africa**: Massive growth. Nigeria alone growing significantly. Will become dominant demographic region.
- **Europe**: By 2032 = 400M people, 60% over age 60. Very small compared to Asia/Africa. Major economic challenge.

### Trade & Tariffs
- **US Strategy**: Tariffs on China, Indonesia. Purpose: Protect domestic companies/jobs. "If we can't stop China, we slow them down"
- **France vs Brazil**: France exports meat/chicken/food. Brazil produces cheaper (larger land, lower costs). French can't compete.

### The G20
- 20 countries with highest GDP, most important exports/imports, best industrialization
- Represents ~50% of global economy
- Spain is part of G20 (example: not about location, about economic power)

### Key Statistics
- Venezuela: 2x Saudi Arabia's oil reserves (but poor country)
- Saudi Arabia: House of Saud, MBS (Mohammed bin Salman), 50+ years business dominance
- Europe: 400M people, 60% over 60 (by 2032)
- China: Biggest exporter, USA: Biggest importer

## CHAPTER 2: CROSS-CULTURAL COMPETENCE

### Culture Definition
- Set of shared beliefs, values, and norms that distinguish one group from another
- Massive and important in business
- Cannot escape culture and communication in international business

### Hofstede's 6 Cultural Dimensions

**1. Power Distance (PDI)**
- **High**: Boss is boss, subordinates blamed for mistakes, not much trust among coworkers, fear of bosses, privileges accepted
- **Low**: Everyone equal, system blamed (not individuals), more trust, equal rights
- **Examples**: USA/Russia/Mexico/Spain/France = high. Sweden/Iceland = low

**2. Individualism vs. Collectivism**
- **Individualism**: "I" consciousness, individual achievement, self-reliance (USA, Australia)
- **Collectivism**: "We" consciousness, group harmony, interdependence (China, India)

**3. Masculinity vs. Femininity**
- **Masculine**: Success = money/power, competitive (Japan, USA)
- **Feminine**: Success = relationships, caring (Nordic countries)
- **Zero Gender Gap**: Norway, Sweden

**4. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI)**
- **High**: Rules matter, uncomfortable with change, traditions important (Japan, France)
- **Low**: Flexible, adventurous, try new things (USA, Australia)

**5. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation**
- **Long-Term**: Think about future, save/invest, plan ahead (China, many Asian countries)
- **Short-Term**: Focus on present, immediate needs (USA example: job → marriage → mortgage → retirement)

**6. Indulgence vs. Restraint**
- **High Indulgence**: "Life is for enjoying!" Buy fun stuff, eat out more (Latin America)
- **Low Restraint**: Discipline first, save, don't spend much on fun (East Asian countries)

### Culture Shock - 4 Phases
1. **Euphoria** (Days-weeks): Everything awesome, excited, high positive feelings
2. **Culture Shock** (Weeks-months, WORST): Everything weird/annoying, want to leave, feel low. CRITICAL DECISION POINT - must stay!
3. **Acculturation** (Months-years): Getting used to it, learning, gaining cultural intelligence, feeling better
4. **Stable State** (Long-term): Feels normal, adapted, comfortable, positive feelings return

### Communication - 35/65 Rule
- **35%** = What you say (words)
- **65%** = How you say it (body language, facial expressions, tone, gestures, eye contact, posture)
- **Key Point**: How you say it matters MORE than what you say. Crucial for negotiations and business.

### Cultural Distance
- Measures how different cultures are (economy, politics, society, geography, communication, language)
- **Small Distance** (easier): USA ↔ UK (same language, similar culture)
- **Large Distance** (harder): USA ↔ Middle East (different language, culture, religion, values)
- Bigger distance = harder to do business, takes longer to adapt

### Cultural Empathy & Intelligence
- Understanding WHY cultures are different (not just that they ARE different)
- Essential for international business success
- Developed through: Education → Training → Integration
- Cannot escape culture and communication - must adapt

### What You Cannot Escape
- **Cannot Escape**: Culture, Communication
- **Can Improve**: Taxes, Logistics, Finance, Situation

## CHAPTER 3: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY

### Market Entry - Risks
When moving company between countries, face multiple risks:
1. **Cultural**: Different norms, values, beliefs, communication barriers
2. **Legal**: Different legal systems, regulations, compliance
3. **Logistical**: Complexity, transportation, supply chain issues
4. **Financial**: Different currencies, exchange rates, financial systems
5. **Market**: Where people buy, market demand, competition
6. **Political**: Stability, government changes, policy changes

### Market Attractiveness Indicators
- **GDP Growth**: Economic growth, market size/potential
- **Population Growth**: Market size indicator, more people = more customers
- **Political Risk Index**: Stability, risks from political changes
- **Categories**: High (USA, UK, France, Germany, China, Japan), Middle, Low

### Competition Strategy
- **GO WHERE COMPETITORS ARE** (not avoid them!)
- **Why**: Market validation, learning opportunity, competition makes you better
- **Real Example**: Company avoided competition in Mexico → lost everything. "What makes you different?" - need to differentiate
- **Warning**: Even professionals can be wrong thinking to escape competition. It's a huge mistake.

### Product Quality & Country Reputation
- **Japan**: Quality leader. High quality = expensive. When you buy from Japan, you buy quality.
- **China**: Volume/repetition. High volume production, lower cost, quality varies. Manufacturing focus.
- **Key Point**: Quality products are expensive. Country reputation matters.

### Global Supply Chain
- **Containerization**: Essential for global transportation. Different container sizes for different goods (dry, humidity-controlled, special)
- **Global Manufacturing**: Parts from multiple countries → assembled in one place (e.g., Boeing: parts from everywhere, assembled in Chicago)
- **Components**: Manufacturing, Logistics, Sales
- **Key Point**: Nothing is 100% from one country anymore. Everything is global.

### Market Entry Simulation
- Manage international strategy for 6 years
- $2 million budget
- Make decisions: countries to enter/grow/exit, entry modes, local market strategies
- Review country information, GDP, population, political risk

### Localization Process
- **Localization** → **Internationalization** → **Globalization**
- Localization: Adapt products/services for local markets
- Necessary before internationalization
- "Think global, act local"
